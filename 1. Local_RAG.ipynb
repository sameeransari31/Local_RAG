Using the ‘ōlelo no‘eau, or  Hawaiian proverb, stated above, we believe that the principles of  nutrition should be taught through the context of our communities  and environments. Its intended audience are students from the  University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa enrolled in the Food Science and  Human Nutrition (FSHN) 185 course, The Science of Human  Nutrition.

The foods we eat contain nutrients. Nutrients are substances  required by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must  be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not  synthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three  basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure,  and/or regulate chemical processes in the body.

These can be metabolically  processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients  comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is  converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work,  allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of  measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels  the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie  multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories,  denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a  capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in  the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other  macronutrients, it does not yield calories.  Carbohydrates  Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and  oxygen. The major food sources of carbohydrates are grains, milk,  fruits, and starchy vegetables, like potatoes. Non-starchy vegetables  also contain carbohydrates, but in lesser quantities. Carbohydrates  are broadly classified into two forms based on their chemical  structure: simple carbohydrates, often called simple sugars; and  complex carbohydrates.  Simple carbohydrates consist of one or two basic units.

There are five key factors that make  up a healthful diet:  1. A diet must be adequate, by providing sufficient amounts of  each essential nutrient, as well as fiber and adequate calories.  2. A balanced diet results when you do not consume one nutrient  at the expense of another, but rather get appropriate amounts  of all nutrients.  3. Calorie control is necessary so that the amount of energy you  get from the nutrients you consume equals the amount of  energy you expend during your day’s activities.  4. Moderation means not eating to the extremes, neither too  much nor too little.  5. Variety refers to consuming different foods from within each  of the food groups on a regular basis.  A healthy diet is one that favors whole foods. As an alternative  to modern processed foods, a healthy diet focuses on “real” fresh  whole foods that have been sustaining people for generations.  Whole foods supply the needed vitamins, minerals, protein,  carbohydrates, fats, and fiber that are essential to good health.  Commercially prepared and fast foods are often lacking nutrients  and often contain inordinate amounts of sugar, salt, saturated and  trans fats, all of which are associated with the development of  diseases such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke, cancer,  obesity, diabetes, and other illnesses.

Nutrient-dense foods are the opposite of  “empty-calorie” foods, such as sugary carbonated beverages, which  are also called “nutrient-poor.” Nutrient-dense foods include fruits  and vegetables, lean meats, poultry, fish, low-fat dairy products, and  whole grains. Choosing more nutrient-dense foods will facilitate  weight loss, while simultaneously providing all necessary nutrients.  Balance  Balance the foods in your diet. Achieving balance in your diet entails  not consuming one nutrient at the expense of another. For example,  calcium is essential for healthy teeth and bones, but too much  calcium will interfere with iron absorption. Most foods that are  good sources of iron are poor sources of calcium, so in order to  get the necessary amounts of calcium and iron from your diet, a  proper balance between food choices is critical. Another example  is that while sodium is an essential nutrient, excessive intake may  contribute to congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease  in some people. Remember, everything must be consumed in the  proper amounts.  Moderation  Eat in moderation. Moderation is crucial for optimal health and  survival.

The first step is ingestion, which is the  intake of food into the digestive tract. It may seem a simple process,  but ingestion involves smelling food, thinking about food, and the  involuntary release of saliva in the mouth to prepare for food entry.  In the mouth, where the second step of digestion starts, the  mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins. The chemical  breakdown of food involves enzymes, such as salivary amylase that  starts the breakdown of large starch molecules into smaller  components.  Mechanical breakdown starts with mastication (chewing) in the  mouth. Teeth crush and grind large food particles, while saliva  provides lubrication and enables food movement downward. The  slippery mass of partially broken-down food is called a bolus, which  moves down the digestive tract as you swallow. Swallowing may  seem voluntary at first because it requires conscious effort to push  the food with the tongue back toward the throat, but after this,  swallowing proceeds involuntarily, meaning it cannot be stopped  72  |  The Digestive System',\n",

Chyme is a semiliquid mass of partially digested food that  also contains gastric juices secreted by cells in the stomach. These  gastric juices contain hydrochloric acid and the enzyme pepsin, that  chemically start breakdown of the protein components of food.  The length of time food spends in the stomach varies by the  macronutrient composition of the meal. A high-fat or high-protein  meal takes longer to break down than one rich in carbohydrates.  It usually takes a few hours after a meal to empty the stomach  contents completely into the small intestine.  The small intestine is divided into three structural parts: the  duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. Once the chyme enters the  duodenum (the first segment of the small intestine), the pancreas  and gallbladder are stimulated and release juices that aid in  digestion. The pancreas secretes up to 1.5 liters (.4 US gallons) of  pancreatic juice through a duct into the duodenum per day. This  fluid consists mostly of water, but it also contains bicarbonate ions  that neutralize the acidity of the stomach-derived chyme and  enzymes that further break down proteins, carbohydrates, and  lipids. The gallbladder secretes a much smaller amount of a fluid  called bile that helps to digest fats. Bile passes through a duct that  joins the pancreatic ducts and is released into the duodenum. Bile  is made in the liver and stored in the gall bladder. Bile’s components  act like detergents by surrounding fats similar to the way dish soap  removes grease from a frying pan.

Its main function is to transport nutrients to cells  and wastes from cells (Figure 2.12 “Cardiovascular Transportation  of Nutrients”). This system consists of the heart, blood, and blood  vessels. The heart pumps the blood, and the blood is the  transportation fluid. The transportation route to all tissues, a highly  intricate blood-vessel network, comprises arteries, veins, and  capillaries. Nutrients absorbed in the small intestine travel mainly to  the liver through the hepatic portal vein. From the liver, nutrients  travel upward through the inferior vena cava blood vessel to the  heart. The heart forcefully pumps the nutrient-rich blood first to  the lungs to pick up some oxygen and then to all other cells in  the body. Arteries become smaller and smaller on their way to  cells, so that by the time blood reaches a cell, the artery’s diameter  is extremely small and the vessel is now called a capillary. The  reduced diameter of the blood vessel substantially slows the speed  of blood flow. This dramatic reduction in blood flow gives cells time  to harvest the nutrients in blood and exchange metabolic wastes.

This is because  cells need to maintain oxidative metabolism for energy production  that continuously regenerates adenosine triphosphate (ATP). For  oxidative phosphorylation to occur, oxygen is used as a reactant and  carbon dioxide is released as a waste product. You may be surprised  to learn that although oxygen is a critical need for cells, it is actually  the accumulation of carbon dioxide that primarily drives your need  to breathe. Carbon dioxide is exhaled and oxygen is inhaled through  the respiratory system, which includes muscles to move air into  and out of the lungs, passageways through which air moves, and  microscopic gas exchange surfaces covered by capillaries. The  cardiovascular system transports gases from the lungs to tissues  throughout the body and vice versa. A variety of diseases can affect  the respiratory system, such as asthma, emphysema, chronic  obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), and lung cancer.

The skeleton is composed of two main  parts, the axial and the appendicular parts. The axial skeleton  consists of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage, and is  composed of eighty bones. The appendicular skeleton consists of  the shoulder girdle, pelvic girdle, and upper and lower extremities,  and is composed of 126 bones. Bones are also categorized by size  and shape. There are four types of bone: long bones, short bones,  flat bones, and irregular bones. The longest bone in your body is the  femur (thigh bone), which extends from your hip to your knee. It is a  long bone and functions to support your weight as you stand, walk,  or run. Your wrist is composed of eight irregular-shaped bones,  which allow for the intricate movements of your hands. Your twelve  ribs on each side of your body are curved flat bones that protect  your heart and lungs. Thus, the bones’ different sizes and shapes  allow for their different functions.  Bones are composed of approximately 65 percent inorganic  material known as mineralized matrix. This mineralized matrix  consists of mostly crystallized hydroxyapatite. The bone’s hard  crystal matrix of bone tissue gives it its rigid structure. The other  35 percent of bone is organic material, most of which is the fibrous  protein collagen. The collagen fibers are networked throughout  bone tissue and provide it with flexibility and strength. The bones’  inorganic and organic materials are structured into two different  tissue types. There is spongy bone, also called trabecular or  cancellous bone, and compact bone, also called cortical bone  (Figure 2.26 “The Arrangement of Bone Tissues”). The two tissue  types differ in their microarchitecture and porosity. Trabecular  bone is 50 to 90 percent porous and appears as a lattice-like  structure under the microscope.

Osteocytes are star-shaped cells that are  networked throughout the bone via their long cytoplasmic arms  that allow for the exchange of nutrients and other factors from  bones to the blood and lymph.  Bone Modeling and Remodeling  During infancy, childhood, and adolescence, bones are continuously  growing and changing shape through two processes called growth  (ossification) and modeling. In fact, in the first year of life, almost  100 percent of the bone tissue in the skeleton is replaced. In the  process of modeling, bone tissue is dismantled at one site and built  up at a different site. In adulthood, our bones stop growing and  modeling, but continue to go through a process of bone remodeling.  In the process of remodeling, bone tissue is degraded and built up  at the same location. About 10 percent of bone tissue is remodeled  each year in adults. Bones adapt their structure to the forces acting  upon them, even in adulthood. This phenomenon is called Wolff’s  law, which states that bones will develop a structure that is best  able to resist the forces acting upon them. This is why exercising,  especially when it involves weight-bearing activities, increases bone  strength.  The first step in bone remodeling is osteocyte activation.  Osteocytes  detect  changes  in  mechanical  forces,  calcium  homeostasis, or hormone levels. In the second step, osteoclasts are  recruited to the site of the degradation. Osteoclasts are large cells  with a highly irregular ruffled membrane. These cells fuse tightly  to the bone and secrete hydrogen ions, which acidify the local  environment and dissolve the minerals in the bone tissue matrix.  This process is called bone resorption and resembles pit excavation.  Our bodies excavate pits in our bone tissue because bones act as  storehouses for calcium and other minerals. Bones supply these  minerals to other body tissues as the demand arises. Bone tissue  The Skeletal System  |  125',\n",

Similar  to measuring blood pressure to predict the risk of stroke, a BMD  measurement can help predict the risk of bone fracture. The most  common tool used to measure BMD is called dual energy X-ray  absorptiometry (DEXA). During this procedure, a person lies on  their back and a DEXA scanner passes two X-ray beams through  their body. The amount of X-ray energy that passes through the  bone is measured for both beams. The total amount of the X-ray  energy that passes through a person varies depending on their bone  thickness. Using this information and a defined area of bone, the  amount of calcified tissue in grams per unit area (cm2) is calculated.  Most often the DEXA scan focuses on measuring BMD in the hip  and the spine. These measurements are then used as indicators of  overall bone strength and health. DEXA is the cheapest and most  accurate way to measure BMD. It also uses the lowest dose of  radiation.

BMI Limitations  A BMI is a fairly simple measurement and does not take into account  fat mass or fat distribution in the body, both of which are additional  predictors of disease risk. Body fat weighs less than muscle mass.  Therefore, BMI can sometimes underestimate the amount of body  fat in overweight or obese people and overestimate it in more  muscular people. For instance, a muscular athlete will have more  muscle mass (which is heavier than fat mass) than a sedentary  individual of the same height. Based on their BMIs the muscular  athlete would be less “ideal” and may be categorized as more  overweight or obese than the sedentary individual; however this is  an infrequent problem with BMI calculation. Additionally, an older  person with osteoporosis (decreased bone mass) will have a lower  BMI than an older person of the same height without osteoporosis,  even though the person with osteoporosis may have more fat mass.  BMI is a useful inexpensive tool to categorize people and is highly  correlative with disease risk, but other measurements are needed to  diagnose obesity and more accurately assess disease risk.

Females have more fat mass, which is needed for reproduction  and, in part, is a consequence of different levels of hormones.

A health professional uses a caliper to  measure the thickness of skin on the back, arm, and other parts of  the body and compares it to standards to assess body fatness.

The  processes involved keep fluids from becoming too dilute or too  concentrated. Fluid compartments are separated by selectively  permeable membranes, which allow some things, such as water,  to move through while other substances require special transport  proteins, channels, and often energy. The movement of water  between fluid compartments happens by osmosis, which is simply  the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane  from an area where it is highly concentrated to an area where it  is not so concentrated. Water is never transported actively; that is,  it never takes energy for water to move between compartments.  Although cells do not directly control water movement, they do  control movement of electrolytes and other solutes and thus  indirectly regulate water movement by controlling where there will  be regions of high and low concentrations.  Cells maintain their water volume at a constant level, but the  composition of solutes in a cell is in a continuous state of flux.  This is because cells are bringing nutrients in, metabolizing them,  and disposing of waste products. To maintain water balance a cell  controls the movement of electrolytes to keep the total number of  dissolved particles, called osmolality the same inside and outside  (Figure 3.3 “Osmoregulation”). The total number of dissolved  substances is the same inside and outside a cell, but the  composition of the fluids differs between compartments.

Human life  is supported within a narrow range of temperature, with the  temperature set point of the body being 98.6°F (37°C).

There are several mechanisms in place that move body water  from place to place as a method to distribute heat in the body and  equalize body temperature (Figure 3.4 “Thermoregulatory Center”).  The hypothalamus in the brain is the thermoregulatory center. The  hypothalamus contains special protein sensors that detect blood  temperature. The skin also contains temperature sensors that  respond quickly to changes in immediate surroundings. In response  to cold sensors in the skin, a neural signal is sent to the  hypothalamus, which then sends a signal to smooth muscle tissue  surrounding blood vessels causing them to constrict and reduce  blood flow. This reduces heat lost to the environment. The  hypothalamus also sends signals to muscles to erect hairs and shiver  and to endocrine glands like the thyroid to secrete hormones  capable of ramping up metabolism.

The thirst mechanism is activated in response to changes in water  volume in the blood, but is even more sensitive to changes in blood  osmolality. Blood osmolality is primarily driven by the concentration  of sodium cations. The urge to drink results from a complex  interplay of hormones and neuronal responses that coordinate to  increase water input and contribute toward fluid balance and  composition in the body. The “thirst center” is contained within  the hypothalamus, a portion of the brain that lies just above the  brainstem. In older people the thirst mechanism is not as responsive  and as we age there is a higher risk for dehydration. Thirst happens  in the following sequence of physiological events:  1. Receptor proteins in the kidney, heart, and hypothalamus  detect decreased fluid volume or increased sodium  concentration in the blood.  2. Hormonal and neural messages are relayed to the brain’s thirst  center in the hypothalamus.  The hypothalamus sends neural signals to higher sensory areas  in the cortex of the brain, stimulating the conscious thought to  drink.  3. Fluids are consumed.  4. Receptors in the mouth and stomach detect mechanical  movements involved with fluid ingestion.  5. Neural signals are sent to the brain and the thirst mechanism  is shut off.  The physiological control of thirst is the backup mechanism to  increase water input. Fluid intake is controlled primarily by  conscious eating and drinking habits dependent on social and  cultural influences. For example, you might have a habit of drinking  a glass of orange juice and eating a bowl of cereal every morning  before school or work.  166  |  Regulation of Water Balance',\n",

In contrast to many minerals,  sodium absorption in the small intestine is extremely efficient and  in a healthy individual all excess sodium is excreted by the kidneys.  In fact, very little sodium is required in the diet (about 200  milligrams) because the kidneys actively reabsorb sodium. Kidney  reabsorption of sodium is hormonally controlled, allowing for a  relatively constant sodium concentration in the blood.  Other Functions of Sodium in the Body  The second notable function of sodium is in nerve impulse  transmission. Nerve impulse transmission results from the  transport of sodium cations into a nerve cell, which creates a charge  difference (or voltage) between the nerve cell and its extracellular  environment. Similar to how a current moves along a wire, a sodium  current moves along a nerve cell. Stimulating a muscle contraction  also involves the movement of sodium ions as well as other ion  movements.  Sodium is essential for nutrient absorption in the small intestine  and also for nutrient reabsorption in the kidney. Amino acids,  glucose and water must make their way from the small intestine to  the blood. To do so, they pass through intestinal cells on their way  to the blood.

Sweat  is mostly water but also contains some electrolytes, mostly sodium  and chloride. Under normal environmental conditions (i.e., not hot,  humid days) water and sodium loss through sweat is negligible,  but is highly variable among individuals. It is estimated that sixty  minutes of high-intensity physical activity, like playing a game of  tennis, can produce approximately one liter of sweat; however the  amount of sweat produced is highly dependent on environmental  conditions. A liter of sweat typically contains between 1 and 2 grams  of sodium and therefore exercising for multiple hours can result in a  high amount of sodium loss in some people. Additionally, hard labor  can produce substantial sodium loss through sweat. In either case,  the lost sodium is easily replaced in the next snack or meal.  In athletes hyponatremia, or a low blood-sodium level, is not  so much the result of excessive sodium loss in sweat, but rather  drinking too much water. The excess water dilutes the sodium  concentration in blood. Illnesses causing vomiting, sweating, and  diarrhea may also cause hyponatremia. The symptoms of  hyponatremia, also called water intoxication (since it is often the  root cause) include nausea, muscle cramps, confusion, dizziness,  and in severe cases, coma and death.

Ninety percent of potassium exists in intracellular fluid, with  about 10 percent in extracellular fluid, and only 1 percent in blood  plasma. As with sodium, potassium levels in the blood are strictly  regulated. The hormone aldosterone is what primarily controls  potassium levels, but other hormones (such as insulin) also play  a role. When potassium levels in the blood increase, the adrenal  glands release aldosterone. The aldosterone acts on the collecting  ducts of kidneys, where it stimulates an increase in the number  of sodium-potassium pumps. Sodium is then reabsorbed and more  potassium is excreted. Because potassium is required for  maintaining sodium levels, and hence fluid balance, about 200  milligrams of potassium are lost from the body every day.  Other Functions of Potassium in the Body  Nerve impulse involves not only sodium, but also potassium. A nerve  impulse moves along a nerve via the movement of sodium ions into  the cell. To end the impulse, potassium ions rush out of the nerve  cell, thereby decreasing the positive charge inside the nerve cell.  This diminishes the stimulus. To restore the original concentrations  of ions between the intracellular and extracellular fluid, the sodium- potassium pump transfers sodium ions out in exchange for  potassium  ions  in.  On  completion  of  the  restored  ion  concentrations, a nerve cell is now ready to receive the next  impulse.

Health Benefits  The most renowned effects of caffeine on the body are increased  alertness and delay of fatigue and sleep. How does caffeine  stimulate the brain? Caffeine is chemically similar to a chemical in  our brains (adenosine). Caffeine interacts with adenosine’s specific  protein receptor. It blocks the actions of the adenosine, and affects  the levels of signaling molecules in the brain, leading to an increase  in energy metabolism. At the molecular level, caffeine stimulates the  brain, increasing alertness and causing a delay of fatigue and sleep.  At high doses caffeine stimulates the motor cortex of the brain and  interferes with the sleep-wake cycle, causing side effects such as  shakiness, anxiety, and insomnia. People’s sensitivity to the adverse  effects of caffeine varies and some people develop side effects at  much lower doses. The many effects caffeine has on the brain do  not diminish with habitual drinking of caffeinated beverages.  Tools for Change  Consuming caffeine in the evening and in the middle of the night  will help keep you awake to study for an exam, but it will not  enhance your performance on the next day’s test if you do not get  enough sleep. Drink caffeinated beverages in moderation at any  time of the day or evening to increase alertness (if you are not  sensitive to caffeine’s adverse effects), but get the recommended  amount of sleep.

A well-concocted sports drink contains  sugar, water, and sodium in the correct proportions so that  hydration is optimized. The sugar is helpful in maintaining blood- glucose levels needed to fuel muscles, the water keeps an athlete  hydrated, and the sodium enhances fluid absorption and replaces  some of that lost in sweat. The American College of Sports Medicine  states that the goal of drinking fluids during exercise is to prevent  dehydration, which compromises performance and endurance.  The primary source of water loss during intense physical activity  is sweat. Perspiration rates are variable and dependent on many  factors including body composition, humidity, temperature, and  type of exercise. The hydration goal for obtaining optimal  endurance and performance is to replace what is lost, not to over- hydrate. A person’s sweating rate can be approximated by  measuring weight before and after exercise—the difference in  weight will be the amount of water weight you lost.  The primary electrolyte lost in sweat is sodium. One liter of sweat  can contain between 1,000–2,000 milligrams of sodium. Potassium,  magnesium, and calcium are also lost, but in much lower amounts. If  you are exercising at high intensity for greater than ninety minutes,  it is important to replace sodium as well as water. This can be partly  accomplished by consuming a sports drink. The highest content of  sodium in commercial sports drinks is approximately 450 milligrams  per liter and thus will not replace all lost sodium unless a person  drinks several liters. This is NOT recommended, as water  intoxication not only compromises performance, but may also be  deadly. The sodium in sports drinks enhances fluid absorption so  that rehydration is more efficiently accomplished. If you are not  exercising for more than ninety minutes at a high intensity, dietary  intake of sodium and other electrolytes should be sufficient for  replacing lost electrolytes.

Children and adult athletes exercising for more than one hour at  high-intensity (tennis, rowing, rugby, soccer, etc.) may benefit  endurance-wise and possibly performance-wise from consuming a  sports drink rather than water. However, consuming sports drinks  provides no benefit over water to endurance, performance, or  exercise recovery for those exercising less than an hour. In fact, as  with all other sugary drinks containing few to no nutrients, they are  only another source of calories. Drinking sports drinks when you  are doing no exercise at all is not recommended.  Sports Drink Alternatives  Instead of a sports drink, you can replenish lost fluids and obtain  energy and electrolytes during exercise by drinking plain water and  eating a sports bar or snack that contains carbohydrates, protein,  and electrolytes.

Chewing, also known as mastication, crumbles the  carbohydrate foods into smaller and smaller pieces. The salivary  glands in the oral cavity secrete saliva that coats the food particles.  Saliva contains the enzyme, salivary amylase. This enzyme breaks  the bonds between the monomeric sugar units of disaccharides,  oligosaccharides, and starches. The salivary amylase breaks down  amylose and amylopectin into smaller chains of glucose, called  dextrins and maltose. The increased concentration of maltose in the  mouth that results from the mechanical and chemical breakdown  of starches in whole grains is what enhances their sweetness. Only  about five percent of starches are broken down in the mouth. (This  is a good thing as more glucose in the mouth would lead to more  tooth decay.) When carbohydrates reach the stomach no further  chemical breakdown occurs because the amylase enzyme does not  function in the acidic conditions of the stomach. But mechanical  breakdown is ongoing—the strong peristaltic contractions of the  stomach mix the carbohydrates into the more uniform mixture of  chyme.

Energy Production  The primary role of carbohydrates is to supply energy to all cells  in the body. Many cells prefer glucose as a source of energy versus  other compounds like fatty acids. Some cells, such as red blood  cells, are only able to produce cellular energy from glucose. The  brain is also highly sensitive to low blood-glucose levels because  it uses only glucose to produce energy and function (unless under  extreme starvation conditions). About 70 percent of the glucose  entering the body from digestion is redistributed (by the liver) back  into the blood for use by other tissues. Cells that require energy  remove the glucose from the blood with a transport protein in their  membranes. The energy from glucose comes from the chemical  bonds between the carbon atoms. Sunlight energy was required to  produce these high-energy bonds in the process of photosynthesis.  Cells in our bodies break these bonds and capture the energy to  perform cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is basically a  controlled burning of glucose versus an uncontrolled burning.

(Recall that sucrose, or table  sugar, is a disaccharide consisting of one glucose unit and one  fructose unit.) HFCS also contains the simple sugars fructose and  glucose, but with fructose at a slightly higher concentration. In  the production of HFCS, corn starch is broken down to glucose,  and some of the glucose is then converted to fructose. Fructose  is sweeter than glucose; hence many food manufacturers choose  to sweeten foods with HFCS. HFCS is used as a sweetener for  carbonated beverages, condiments, cereals, and a great variety of  other processed foods.  Some scientists, public health personnel, and healthcare  providers believe that fructose is the cause of the obesity epidemic  and its associated health consequences. The majority of their  evidence stems from the observation that since the early 1970s  the number of overweight or obese Americans has dramatically  increased and so has the consumption of foods containing HFCS.

Now that we know the benefits of eating the right  carbohydrate, we will examine exactly how much should be eaten to  promote health and prevent disease.  How Many Carbohydrates Does a Person Need?  The Food and Nutrition Board of IOM has set the Recommended  Dietary Allowance (RDA) of carbohydrates for children and adults  at 130 grams per day. This is the average minimum amount the  brain requires to function properly. The Acceptable Macronutrient  Distribution Range (AMDR) for carbohydrates is between 45 and  65 percent of your total caloric daily intake. This means that on  a 2,000 kilocalorie diet, a person should consume between 225  and 325 grams of carbohydrate each day. According to the IOM  not more than 25 percent of total calories consumed should come  from added sugars. The World Health Organization and the AHA  recommend much lower intakes of added sugars—10 percent or less  of total calories consumed. The IOM has also set Adequate Intakes  for dietary fiber, which are 38 and 25 grams for men and women,  respectively.

It’s the Whole Nutrient Package  In choosing dietary sources of carbohydrates the best ones are  those that are nutrient dense, meaning they contain more essential  nutrients per calorie of energy. In general, nutrient-dense  carbohydrates are minimally processed and include whole-grain  breads and cereals, low-fat dairy products, fruits, vegetables, and  beans. In contrast, empty-calorie carbohydrate foods are highly  processed and often contain added sugars and fats. Soft drinks,  cakes, cookies, and candy are examples of empty-calorie  carbohydrates.  They  are  sometimes  referred  to  as  ‘bad  carbohydrates,’ as they are known to cause health problems when  consumed in excess.  Understanding Carbohydrates from Product  Information  While nutrition facts labels aid in determining the amount of  carbohydrates you eat, they do not help in determining whether  a food is refined or not. The ingredients list provides some help  in this regard. It identifies all of the food’s ingredients in order of  concentration, with the most concentrated ingredient first. When  choosing between two breads, pick the one that lists whole wheat  (not wheat flour) as the first ingredient, and avoid those with other  flour ingredients, such as white flour or corn flour.

To accomplish  these recommendations use some or all of the following  suggestions:  • Get more daily carbohydrate servings from whole grains by  eating a whole-grain cereal for breakfast, using whole-grain  bread to make a sandwich for lunch, and eating a serving of  beans and/or nuts with dinner.  • Make sure to get at least three servings (or more) of all the  grains you eat as whole grains every day. A serving of whole  grains is equal to one slice of whole-wheat bread, one ounce of  whole-grain cereal, and one-half cup of cooked cereal, brown  rice, or whole-wheat pasta.

The Food Industry: Functional Attributes of  Carbohydrates and the Use of Sugar Substitutes  In the food industry, both fast-releasing and slow-releasing  carbohydrates are utilized to give foods a wide spectrum of  functional attributes, including increased sweetness, viscosity, bulk,  coating ability, solubility, consistency, texture, body, and browning  capacity. The differences in chemical structure between the  different carbohydrates confer their varied functional uses in foods.  Starches, gums, and pectins are used as thickening agents in making  jam, cakes, cookies, noodles, canned products, imitation cheeses,  and a variety of other foods. Molecular gastronomists use slow- releasing carbohydrates, such as alginate, to give shape and texture  to their fascinating food creations. Adding fiber to foods increases  bulk. Simple sugars are used not only for adding sweetness, but  also to add texture, consistency, and browning. In ice cream, the  combination of sucrose and corn syrup imparts sweetness as well as  a glossy appearance and smooth texture.  Due to the potential health consequences of consuming too many  added sugars, sugar substitutes have replaced them in many foods  and beverages.

So, normal fat reserves are a signal that metabolic processes  are efficient and a person is healthy.  Lipids are a family of organic compounds that are mostly insoluble  in water. Composed of fats and oils, lipids are molecules that yield  high energy and have a chemical composition mainly of carbon,  hydrogen, and oxygen. Lipids perform three primary biological  functions within the body: they serve as structural components of  cell membranes, function as energy storehouses, and function as  important signaling molecules.  The three main types of lipids are triglycerides, phospholipids,  and sterols. Triglycerides make up more than 95 percent of lipids  in the diet and are commonly found in fried foods, vegetable oil,  butter, whole milk, cheese, cream cheese, and some meats.  Naturally occurring triglycerides are found in many foods, including  avocados, olives, corn, and nuts. We commonly call the triglycerides  in our food “fats” and “oils.” Fats are lipids that are solid at room  temperature, whereas oils are liquid. As with most fats, triglycerides  do not dissolve in water. The terms fats, oils, and triglycerides are  discretionary and can be used interchangeably. In this chapter when  we use the word fat, we are referring to triglycerides.  Phospholipids make up only about 2 percent of dietary lipids.  They are water-soluble and are found in both plants and animals.  Phospholipids are crucial for building the protective barrier, or  membrane, around your body’s cells. In fact, phospholipids are  synthesized in the body to form cell and organelle membranes. In  blood and body fluids, phospholipids form structures in which fat is  enclosed and transported throughout the bloodstream.  Sterols are the least common type of lipid. Cholesterol is perhaps  the best well-known sterol. Though cholesterol has a notorious  reputation, the body gets only a small amount of its cholesterol  through food—the body produces most of it. Cholesterol is an  important component of the cell membrane and is required for the  synthesis of sex hormones, and bile salts.  Introduction  |  293',\n",

Foods that are  high in fat contain more calories than foods high in protein or  carbohydrates. As a result, high-fat foods are a convenient source  of energy. For example, 1 gram of fat or oil provides 9 kilocalories  of energy, compared with 4 kilocalories found in 1 gram of  carbohydrate or protein. Depending on the level of physical activity  and on nutritional needs, fat requirements vary greatly from person  to person. When energy needs are high, the body welcomes the  high-caloric density of fats. For instance, infants and growing  children require proper amounts of fat to support normal growth  and development. If an infant or child is given a low-fat diet for  an extended period, growth and development will not progress  normally. Other individuals with high-energy needs are athletes,  people who have physically demanding jobs, and those recuperating  from illness.

       "  'text': 'Nonessential and Essential  Fatty Acids  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  Fatty acids are vital for the normal operation of all body systems.  The circulatory system, respiratory system, integumentary system,  immune system, brain, and other organs require fatty acids for  proper function. The body is capable of synthesizing most of the  fatty acids it needs from food. These fatty acids are known as  nonessential fatty acids. However, there are some fatty acids that  the body cannot synthesize and these are called essential fatty  acids. It is important to note that nonessential fatty acids doesn’t  mean unimportant; the classification is based solely on the ability of  the body to synthesize the fatty acid.  Essential fatty acids must be obtained from food. They fall into  two categories—omega-3 and omega-6. The 3 and 6 refer to the  position of the first carbon double bond and the omega refers to  the methyl end of the chain.

Do you think of heart disease, heart health, or  atherosclerosis? Most people probably do not. As we uncover what  hydrogenation is and why manufacturers use it, you will be better  equipped to adhere to healthier dietary choices and promote your  heart health.  Hydrogenation: The Good Gone Bad?  Food manufacturers are aware that fatty acids are susceptible to  attack by oxygen molecules because their points of unsaturation  render them vulnerable in this regard. When oxygen molecules  attack these points of unsaturation the modified fatty acid becomes  oxidized. The oxidation of fatty acids makes the oil rancid and gives  the food prepared with it an unappetizing taste. Because oils can  undergo oxidation when stored in open containers, they must be  stored in airtight containers and possibly be refrigerated to  minimize damage from oxidation. Hydrogenation poses a solution  that food manufacturers prefer.  When lipids are subjected to hydrogenation, the molecular  structure of the fat is altered. Hydrogenation is the process of  adding hydrogen to unsaturated fatty-acid chains, so that the  hydrogen atoms are connected to the points of saturation and  results in a more saturated fatty acid.

A Prelude to Disease  If left unchecked, improper dietary fat consumption can lead down  a path to severe health problems. An increased level of lipids,  triglycerides, and cholesterol in the blood is called hyperlipidemia.  Hyperlipidemia is inclusive of several conditions but more  commonly refers to high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. When  blood lipid levels are high, any number of adverse health problems  may ensue. Consider the following:  • Cardiovascular disease. According to the AHA, cardiovascular  disease encompasses a variety of problems, many of which are  related to the process of atherosclerosis. Over time the  arteries thicken and harden with plaque buildup, causing  restricted or at times low or no blood flow to selected areas of  the body.  • Heart attack. A heart attack happens when blood flow to a  section of the heart is cut off due to a blood clot. Many have  survived heart attacks and go on to return to their lives and  enjoy many more years of life on this earth. However, dietary  and lifestyle changes must be implemented to prevent further  attacks.  • Ischemic stroke. The most common type of stroke in the  United States, ischemic stroke, occurs when a blood vessel in  the brain or leading to the brain becomes blocked, again  usually from a blood clot.

Limiting the intake of saturated fats and trans fats,  increasing physical activity, and eating fewer calories are all  equally important in this fight against obesity.  What You Can Do  Remember that saturated fats are found in large amounts in foods  of animal origin. They should be limited within the diet.  Polyunsaturated fats are generally obtained from non-animal  sources. While they are beneficial for lowering bad cholesterol they  also lower good cholesterol. They are better for you than saturated  fats but are not to be consumed in excess. Monounsaturated fats  are of plant origin and are found in most nuts, seeds, seed oils, olive  oil, canola oil, and legumes. Monounsaturated fats are excellent  because they not only lower bad cholesterol, but also they elevate  the good cholesterol. Replace current dietary fats with an increased  intake of monounsaturated fats.  Choose whole-grain and high-fiber foods. Reduced risk for  cardiovascular disease has been associated with diets that are high  in whole grains and fiber. Fiber also slows down cholesterol  absorption. The AHA recommends that at least half of daily grain  intake should originate from whole grains. The Adequate Intake  value for fiber is 14 grams per 1,000 kilocalories. These amounts  are based upon the amount of fiber that has been shown to reduce  cardiovascular risk.  Do not be sedentary. Get more exercise on a regular basis.  Increasing your energy expenditure by just twenty minutes of  physical activity at least three times per week will improve your  overall health.

Thus, it is important to  learn to reduce the intake of foods high in saturated fat. High- fat foods can be consumed but they must fall within the overall  goal for a person’s fat allowance for the day.  • Home cooking. Limit the use of saturated fats in home  preparation of meals. Instead of butter try spreads made from  unsaturated oils such as canola or olive oils and the use of  cooking sprays. Couple this with the use of herbs and spices to  add flavor. Avoid using high-fat meat gravies, cheese, and  cream sauces. Limit adding extras to foods such as butter on a  baked potato. Use nonfat sour cream instead.

The word protein is a Greek word,  meaning “of utmost importance.” Proteins are called the workhorses  of life as they provide the body with structure and perform a vast  array of functions. You can stand, walk, run, skate, swim, and more  because of your protein-rich muscles. Protein is necessary for  proper immune system function, digestion, and hair and nail  growth, and is involved in numerous other body functions. In fact,  it is estimated that more than one hundred thousand different  proteins exist within the human body. In this chapter you will learn  about the components of protein, the important roles that protein  serves within the body, how the body uses protein, the risks and  consequences associated with too much or too little protein, and  where to find healthy sources of it in your diet.  What Is Protein?  Proteins, simply put, are macromolecules composed of amino acids.  Amino acids are commonly called protein’s building blocks. Proteins  are crucial for the nourishment, renewal, and continuance of life.  Proteins contain the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen just  as carbohydrates and lipids do, but proteins are the only  macronutrient that contains nitrogen. In each amino acid the  elements are arranged into a specific conformation around a carbon  center. Each amino acid consists of a central carbon atom  connected to a side chain, a hydrogen, a nitrogen-containing amino  group, and a carboxylic acid group—hence the name “amino acid.”  Defining Protein  |  363',\n",

The acidity of the stomach facilitates  the unfolding of the proteins that still retain part of their three- dimensional structure after cooking and helps break down the  protein aggregates formed during cooking. Pepsin, which is  secreted by the cells that line the stomach, dismantles the protein  chains into smaller and smaller fragments. Egg proteins are large  globular molecules and their chemical breakdown requires time  and mixing.

Wound Healing and Tissue Regeneration  Proteins are involved in all aspects of wound healing, a process  that takes place in three phases: inflammatory, proliferative, and  remodeling. For example, if you were sewing and pricked your  finger with a needle, your flesh would turn red and become  inflamed. Within a few seconds bleeding would stop. The healing  process begins with proteins such as bradykinin, which dilate blood  vessels at the site of injury. An additional protein called fibrin helps  to secure platelets that form a clot to stop the bleeding. Next, in  the proliferative phase, cells move in and mend the injured tissue by  installing newly made collagen fibers. The collagen fibers help pull  the wound edges together. In the remodeling phase, more collagen  is deposited, forming a scar. Scar tissue is only about 80 percent  as functional as normal uninjured tissue. If a diet is insufficient in  protein, the process of wound healing is markedly slowed.  While wound healing takes place only after an injury is sustained,  a different process called tissue regeneration is ongoing in the body.

The name Kwashiorkor comes  from a language in Ghana and means, “rejected one.” The syndrome  was named because it occurred most commonly in children who  had recently been weaned from the breast, usually because another  child had just been born. Subsequently the child was fed watery  porridge made from low-protein grains, which accounts for the low  protein intake. Kwashiorkor is characterized by swelling (edema) of  the feet and abdomen, poor skin health, growth retardation, low  muscle mass, and liver malfunction. Recall that one of protein’s  functional roles in the body is fluid balance. Diets extremely low  in protein do not provide enough amino acids for the synthesis  of albumin. One of the functions of albumin is to hold water in  the blood vessels, so having lower concentrations of blood albumin  results in water moving out of the blood vessels and into tissues,  causing swelling. The primary symptoms of Kwashiorkor include not  only swelling, but also diarrhea, fatigue, peeling skin, and irritability.  Severe protein deficiency in addition to other micronutrient  deficiencies, such as folate (vitamin B9), iodine, iron, and vitamin C  all contribute to the many health manifestations of this syndrome.

Protein Input = Protein Used by the Body + Protein Excreted  The appropriate amount of protein in a person’s diet is that which  maintains a balance between what is taken in and what is used. The  RDAs for protein were determined by assessing nitrogen balance.  Nitrogen is one of the four basic elements contained in all amino  acids. When proteins are broken down and amino acids are  catabolized, nitrogen is released. Remember that when the liver  breaks down amino acids, it produces ammonia, which is rapidly  converted to nontoxic, nitrogen-containing urea, which is then  transported to the kidneys for excretion. Most nitrogen is lost as  urea in the urine, but urea is also excreted in the feces. Proteins are  also lost in sweat and as hair and nails grow. The RDA, therefore,  is the amount of protein a person should consume in their diet to  balance the amount of protein used up and lost from the body. For  healthy adults, this amount of protein was determined to be 0.8  grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. You can calculate  410  |  Proteins, Diet, and Personal Choices',\n",

The IOM used data from multiple studies that determined  nitrogen balance in people of different age groups to calculate the  RDA for protein. A person is said to be in nitrogen balance when the  nitrogen input equals the amount of nitrogen used and excreted.

       "  'text': 'Effects of Alcohol Abuse on the Brain  A small amount (up to 10%) of the liver acetaldehyde may  accumulate inside the liver cells. As more alcohol is ingested, this  stimulates the production of acetaldehyde by both the alcohol  dehydrogenase and MEOS systems. As the levels of acetaldehyde  increase inside the liver cells with heavy consumption of alcohol,  some of the acetaldehyde diffuse into the blood circulation. In  circulation, high levels of acetaldehyde cause nausea and vomiting.  Vomiting causes more body dehydration and loss of electrolytes.  If the dehydration becomes severe enough, this can impair brain  function and a person may lose consciousness.  Alcohol can adversely affect nearly every area of the brain. When  BAC rises, the central nervous system is depressed. Alcohol disrupts  the way nerve cells communicate with each other by interfering  with receptors on certain cells. The immediate impact of alcohol  on the brain can be seen in the awkwardly displayed symptoms  of confusion, blurred vision, slurred speech, and other signs of  intoxication. These symptoms will go away once drinking stops,  but abusive alcohol consumption over time can lead to long-lasting  damage to the brain and nervous system.

       "  'text': 'Metabolism Overview  Metabolism is defined as the sum of all chemical reactions required  to support cellular function and hence the life of an organism.  Metabolism is either categorized as catabolism, referring to all  metabolic processes involved in molecule breakdown, or anabolism,  which includes all metabolic processes involved in building bigger  molecules. Generally, catabolic processes release energy and  anabolic processes consume energy. The overall goals of  metabolism are energy transfer and matter transport. Energy is  transformed from food macronutrients into cellular energy, which  is used to perform cellular work. Metabolism transforms the matter  of macronutrients into substances a cell can use to grow and  reproduce and also into waste products. For example, enzymes are  proteins and their job is to catalyze chemical reactions. Catalyze  means to speed-up a chemical reaction and reduce the energy  required to complete the chemical reaction, without the catalyst  being used up in the reaction. Without enzymes, chemical reactions  would not happen at a fast enough rate and would use up too  much energy for life to exist. A metabolic pathway is a series of  enzyme catalyzed reactions that transform the starting material  (known as a substrate) into intermediates, that are the substrates  for subsequent enzymatic reactions in the pathway, until, finally,  an end product is synthesized by the last enzymatic reaction in  the pathway. Some metabolic pathways are complex and involve  many enzymatic reactions, and others involve only a few chemical  reactions.  To ensure cellular efficiency, the metabolic pathways involved in  catabolism and anabolism are regulated in concert by energy status,  hormones, and substrate and end-product levels.

Then we will consider the other  factors that play a role in maintaining energy balance and hence,  body weight.  Estimating Energy Requirement  To maintain body weight you have to balance the calories obtained  from food and beverages with the calories expended every day.  Here, we will discuss how to calculate your energy needs in  kilocalories per day so that you can determine whether your caloric  intake falls short, meets, or exceeds your energy needs. The  Institute of Medicine has devised a formula for calculating your  Estimated Energy Requirement (EER). It takes into account your  age, sex, weight, height, and physical activity level (PA). The EER is  a standardized mathematical prediction of a person’s daily energy  needs in kilocalories per day required to maintain weight. It is  calculated for those over 18 years of age via the following formulas:  Adult male: EER = 662 − [9.53 X age (y)] + PA X [15.91 X wt (kg) +  5.39.6 X ht (m)]  Adult female: EER = 354 − [6.91 x age (y)] + PA x [9.36 x wt (kg) +  726 x ht (m)]  Note: to convert pounds to kilograms, divide weight in pounds by  2.2. To convert feet to meters, divide height in feet by 3.3.

BMR is dependent on body size,  body composition, sex, age, nutritional status, and genetics. People  with a larger frame size have a higher BMR simply because they  have more mass. Muscle tissue burns more calories than fat tissue  even while at rest and thus the more muscle mass a person has, the  higher their BMR. Since females typically have less muscle mass and  a smaller frame size than men, their BMRs are generally lower than  men’s. As we get older muscle mass declines and thus so does BMR.  Nutritional status also affects basal metabolism. Caloric restriction,  as occurs while dieting, for example, causes a decline in BMR. This is  because the body attempts to maintain homeostasis and will adapt  by slowing down its basic functions to offset the decrease in energy  intake.

The discovery of leptin’s functions sparked a craze in the  research world and the diet pill industry, as it was hypothesized that  if you give leptin to a person who is overweight, they will decrease  their food intake. Alas, this is not the case. In several clinical trials  it was found that people who are overweight or obese are actually  resistant to the hormone, meaning their brain does not respond as  well to it.1  Therefore, when you administer leptin to an overweight or obese  person there is no sustained effect on food intake.  Nutrients themselves also play a role in influencing food intake.  The hypothalamus senses nutrient levels in the blood. When they  are low the hunger center is stimulated, and when they are high  the satiety center is stimulated. Furthermore, cravings for salty  and sweet foods have an underlying physiological basis. Both  undernutrition and overnutrition affect hormone levels and the  neural circuitry controlling appetite, which makes losing or gaining  weight a substantial physiological hurdle.  Genetic Influences  Genetics certainly play a role in body fatness and weight and also  affects food intake. Children who have been adopted typically are  similar in weight and body fatness to their biological parents.  Moreover, identical twins are twice as likely to be of similar weights  1.\\xa0Dardeno TA, Chou, SH, et al.(2010). \\xa0Leptin in Human  Physiology and Therapeutics.

Escalators, moving walkways, and elevators  (not to mention cars!) are common modes of transportation that  reduce average daily energy expenditure. Office work, high-stress  jobs, and occupations requiring extended working hours are all  societal pressures that reduce the time allotted for exercise of large  populations of Americans. Even the remote controls that many have  for various electronic devices in their homes contribute to the US  society being less active. More obesogenic factors were discussed in  the weight management section of this chapter.  Socioeconomic status has been found to be inversely proportional  to weight gain. One reason for this relationship is that inhabitants  of low-income neighborhoods have reduced access to safe streets  and parks for walking.

Vitamin D Functions and Health Benefits  Vitamin D refers to a group of fat-soluble vitamins derived from  cholesterol. Vitamins D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (calcitriol) are the  only ones known to have biological actions in the human body.  The skin synthesizes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. In fact,  for most people, more than 90 percent of their vitamin D3 comes  from the casual exposure to the UVB rays in sunlight. Anything  that reduces your exposure to the sun’s UVB rays decreases the  amount of vitamin D3 your skin synthesizes. That would include  long winters, your home’s altitude, whether you are wearing  sunscreen, and the color of your skin (including tanned skin). Do you  ever wonder about an increased risk for skin cancer by spending too  much time in the sun? Do not fret. Less than thirty minutes of sun  exposure to the arms and legs will increase blood levels of vitamin  D3 more than orally taking 10,000 IU (250 micrograms) of vitamin  D3.

In fact, British sailors in the past were often referred  to as “limeys” as they carried sacks of limes onto ships to prevent  scurvy. Vitamin C is not found in significant amounts in animal- based foods.  Because vitamin C is water-soluble, it leaches away from foods  considerably during cooking, freezing, thawing, and canning.

It is prevalent in societies  whose main dietary staple is white rice. During the processing of  white rice, the bran is removed, along with what were called in  the early nineteenth century, “accessory factors,” that are vital for  metabolism. Dutch physician Dr. Christiaan Eijkman cured chickens  of beriberi by feeding them unpolished rice bran in 1897.

Updated February 11,  2016. Accessed October 22, 2017.  Niacin (B3)  Niacin is a component of the coenzymes NADH and NADPH, which  are involved in the catabolism and/or anabolism of carbohydrates,  lipids, and proteins. NADH is the predominant electron carrier and  transfers electrons to the electron-transport chain to make ATP.  NADPH is also required for the anabolic pathways of fatty-acid  and cholesterol synthesis. In contrast to other vitamins, niacin can  be synthesized by humans from the amino acid tryptophan in an  anabolic process requiring enzymes dependent on riboflavin,  vitamin B6, and iron. Niacin is made from tryptophan only after  tryptophan has met all of its other needs in the body. The  contribution of tryptophan-derived niacin to niacin needs in the  body varies widely and a few scientific studies have demonstrated  that diets high in tryptophan have very little effect on niacin  deficiency. Niacin deficiency is commonly known as pellagra and  the symptoms include fatigue, decreased appetite, and indigestion.  \\xa0These symptoms are then commonly followed by the four D’s:  diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and sometimes death.

In order for the human body to absorb vitamin B12,  the stomach, pancreas, and small intestine must be functioning  properly. Cells in the stomach secrete a protein called intrinsic  factor that is necessary for vitamin B12 absorption, which occurs in  the small intestine. Impairment of secretion of this protein either  caused by an autoimmune disease or by chronic inflammation of  the stomach (such as that occurring in some people with H.pylori  infection), can lead to the disease pernicious anemia, a type of  macrocytic anemia. Vitamin B12 malabsorption is most common in  the elderly, who may have impaired functioning of digestive organs,  a normal consequence of aging.

Similarly,  depletion of B vitamins will cause problems in energy metabolism,  but having more than is required to run metabolism does not speed  it up. Buyers of B-vitamin supplements beware; B vitamins are not  stored in the body and all excess will be flushed down the toilet  along with the extra money spent.  B vitamins are naturally present in numerous foods, and many  other foods are enriched with them. In the United States, B-vitamin  deficiencies are rare; however in the nineteenth century some  vitamin-B deficiencies plagued many people in North America.  Niacin deficiency, also known as pellagra, was prominent in poorer  Americans whose main dietary staple was refined cornmeal. Its  symptoms were severe and included diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia,  and even death. Some of the health consequences of pellagra are  the result of niacin being in insufficient supply to support the body’s  metabolic functions.

Thus, as a woman ages and goes through menopause,  during which estrogen levels fall, the amount of calcium absorbed  decreases and the risk for bone disease increases.

The iron in hemoglobin binds to oxygen in the capillaries of the  lungs and transports it to cells where the oxygen is released. If iron  level is low hemoglobin is not synthesized in sufficient amounts  and the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells is reduced,  resulting in anemia. When iron levels are low in the diet the small  intestine more efficiently absorbs iron in an attempt to compensate  for the low dietary intake, but this process cannot make up for  the excessive loss of iron that occurs with chronic blood loss or  low intake. When blood cells are decommissioned for use, the body  recycles the iron back to the bone marrow where red blood cells  are made. The body stores some iron in the bone marrow, liver,  spleen, and skeletal muscle. A relatively small amount of iron is  excreted when cells lining the small intestine and skin cells die and  in blood loss, such as during menstrual bleeding. The lost iron must  be replaced from dietary sources.  The bioavailability of iron is highly dependent on dietary sources.  In animal-based foods about 60 percent of iron is bound to  hemoglobin, and heme iron is more bioavailable than nonheme iron.  The other 40 percent of iron in animal-based foods is nonheme,  which is the only iron source in plant-based foods. Some plants  contain chemicals (such as phytate, oxalates, tannins, and  polyphenols) that inhibit iron absorption. Although, eating fruits and  vegetables rich in vitamin C at the same time as iron-containing  foods markedly increases iron absorption. A review in the American  Journal of Clinical Nutrition reports that in developed countries iron  bioavailability from mixed diets ranges between 14 and 18 percent,  and that from vegetarian diets ranges between 5 and 12 percent.1  1.\\xa0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Iron and  Iron Deficiency.” Accessed October 2, 2011.  656  |  Iron',\n",

In  the United States, the high incidence of iron-deficiency anemia in  infants and children was a major public-health problem prior to the  early 1970s, but now the incidence has been greatly reduced.

This includes  people who are participating in programs such as the Special  Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children. The  DRI is not appropriate for people who are ill or malnourished, even  if they were healthy previously.  Determining Dietary Reference Intakes  Each DRI value is derived in a different way. See below for an  explanation of how each is determined:  1. Estimated Average Requirements. The EAR for a nutrient is  determined by a committee of nutrition experts who review  the scientific literature to determine a value that meets the  requirements of 50 percent of people in their target group  within a given life stage and for a particular sex. The  requirements of half of the group will fall below the EAR and  the other half will be above it. It is important to note that, for  each nutrient, a specific bodily function is chosen as the  criterion on which to base the EAR. For example, the EAR for  calcium is set using a criterion of maximizing bone health.  Thus, the EAR for calcium is set at a point that will meet the  needs, with respect to bone health, of half of the population.

       "  'text': 'EAR values become the scientific foundation upon which RDA  values are set.  2. Recommended Daily Allowances. Once the EAR of a nutrient  has been established, the RDA can be mathematically  determined. While the EAR is set at a point that meets the  needs of half the population, RDA values are set to meet the  needs of the vast majority (97 to 98 percent) of the target  healthy population. It is important to note that RDAs are not  the same thing as individual nutritional requirements. The  actual nutrient needs of a given individual will be different  than the RDA. However, since we know that 97 to 98 percent of  the population’s needs are met by the RDA, we can assume that  if a person is consuming the RDA of a given nutrient, they are  most likely meeting their nutritional need for that nutrient.  The important thing to remember is that the RDA is meant as a  recommendation and meeting the RDA means it is very likely  that you are meeting your actual requirement for that nutrient.  Understanding the Difference  There is a distinct difference between a requirement and a  recommendation. For instance, the DRI for vitamin D is a  recommended 600 international units each day. However, in order  to find out your true personal requirements for vitamin D, a blood  test is necessary. The blood test will provide an accurate reading  from which a medical professional can gauge your required daily  vitamin D amounts. This may be considerably more or less than the  DRI, depending on what your level actually is.  1. Adequate Intake. AIs are created for nutrients when there is  insufficient consistent scientific evidence to set an EAR for the  entire population. As with RDAs, AIs can be used as nutrient- intake goals for a given nutrient. For example, there has not  712  |  Understanding Dietary Reference Intakes',\n",

All other values listed thereafter, from the calories to the  dietary fiber, are based on this one serving. On the panel, the  serving size is followed by the number of calories and then a list  of selected nutrients. You will also see “Percent Daily Value” on the  far right-hand side. This helps you determine if the food is a good  source of a particular nutrient or not.  The Daily Value (DV) represents the recommended amount of  a given nutrient based on the RDA of that nutrient in a  2,000-kilocalorie diet. The DV was updated as part of the new  nutrition facts label announced in May 2016. The updated DV applies  to packaged food, beverages and dietary supplements that contain  ingredients with a DV.\\xa0The percentage of Daily Value (percent DV)  represents the proportion of the total daily recommended amount  that you will get from one serving of the food. For example, in the  older food label in Figure 12.2 “Reading the Older Nutrition Label,”  the percent DV of calcium for one serving of macaroni-and-cheese  is 20 percent, which means that one serving of macaroni and cheese  provides 20 percent of the daily recommended calcium intake. Since  the DV for calcium is 1,300 milligrams, the food producer  determined the percent DV for calcium by taking the calcium  content in milligrams in each serving, and dividing it by 1,300  milligrams, and then multiplying it by 100 to get it into percentage  format. Whether you consume 2,000 calories per day or not you can  still use the percent DV as a target reference.  Generally, a percent DV of 5 is considered low and a percent  DV of 20 is considered high. This means, as a general rule, for fat,  saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium, look for foods with  a low percent DV. Alternatively, when concentrating on essential  mineral or vitamin intake, look for a high percent DV. To figure  out your fat allowance remaining for the day after consuming one  serving of macaroni-and-cheese, look at the percent DV for fat,  which is 18 percent, and subtract it from 100 percent. To know this  amount in grams of fat, read the footnote of the food label to find  that the recommended maximum amount of fat grams to consume  720  |  Discovering Nutrition Facts',\n",

Updated February 10, 2012. Accessed  November 28, 2017.  Health Claims  Often we hear news of a particular nutrient or food product that  contributes to our health or may prevent disease. A health claim  is a statement that links a particular food with a reduced risk of  developing disease. \\xa0Implied health claims include the use of  symbols, statements and other forms of communication that  suggest a relationship between a food\\xa0 substance and disease  reduction. As such, health claims such as “Three grams of soluble  fiber from oatmeal daily in combination with a diet low in  cholesterol and saturated fat may reduce the risk of heart disease,”  must be evaluated by the FDA before it may appear on packaging.  Prior to the passage of the NLEA products that made such claims  were categorized as drugs and not food. All health claims must be  substantiated by scientific evidence in order for it to be approved  and put on a food label. To avoid having companies making false  claims, laws also regulate how health claims are presented on food  packaging. In addition to the claim being backed up by scientific  evidence, it may never claim to diagnose, mitigate, cure or treat  the disease.

Fill a quarter of your plate with whole grains such as 100 percent  whole-grain cereals, breads, crackers, rice, and pasta. Half of your  daily grain intake should be whole grains. Read the ingredients list  on food labels carefully to determine if a food is comprised of whole  grains.  Select a variety of protein foods to improve nutrient intake and  promote health benefits. Each week, be sure to include a nice array  of protein sources in your diet, such as nuts, seeds, beans, legumes,  poultry, soy, and seafood. The recommended consumption amount  for seafood for adults is two 4-ounce servings per week. When  choosing meat, select lean cuts. Be conscious to prepare meats  using little or no added saturated fat, such as butter.  If you enjoy drinking milk or eating milk products, such as cheese  and yogurt, choose low-fat or nonfat products. Low-fat and nonfat  products contain the same amount of calcium and other essential  nutrients as whole-milk products, but with much less fat and  calories.

       "  'text': 'Image by  Wolfgang  Moroder /  CC BY-SA  3.0  We begin with pregnancy, a developmental marathon that lasts  about forty weeks. It begins with the first trimester (weeks one to  week twelve), extends into the second trimester (weeks thirteen  to week twenty-seven), and ends with the third trimester (week  twenty-eight to birth). At conception, a sperm cell fertilizes an egg  cell, creating a zygote. The zygote rapidly divides into multiple cells  to become an embryo and implants itself in the uterine wall, where,  by the end of the 8th week after conception, it develops into a  fetus.

One  of the most notable and significant changes is weight gain. If a  pregnant woman does not gain enough weight, her unborn baby  will be at risk. Poor weight gain, especially in the second and third  trimesters, could result not only in low birth weight, but also infant  mortality and intellectual disabilities. Therefore, it is vital for a  pregnant woman to maintain a healthy amount of weight gain. Her  weight prior to pregnancy also has a major effect. Infant birth  weight is one of the best indicators of a baby’s future health.  Pregnant women of normal prepregnancy weight should gain  between 25 and 35 pounds in total through the entire pregnancy.

Pregnant  women must consume more calories and nutrients in the second  and third trimesters than other adult women. However, the average  recommended daily caloric intake can vary depending on activity  level and the mother’s normal weight. Also, pregnant women should  choose a high-quality, diverse diet, consume fresh foods, and  prepare nutrient-rich meals. Steaming is one of the best ways to  cook vegetables. Vitamins are destroyed by overcooking, whereas  uncooked vegetables and fruits have the highest vitamin content.  It is also recommended for pregnant women to take prenatal  supplements  to  ensure  adequate  intake  of  the  needed  micronutrients.  Energy and Macronutrients  During the first trimester, a pregnant woman has the same energy  requirements as normal and should consume the same number of  calories as usual. However, as the pregnancy progresses, a woman  must increase her caloric intake. According to the IOM, she should  consume an additional 340 calories per day during the second  trimester, and an additional 450 calories per day during the third  trimester. This is partly due to an increase in metabolism, which  occurs during pregnancy and contributes to increased energy  needs. A woman can easily meet these increased needs by  consuming more nutrient-dense foods.  The recommended daily allowance, or RDA, of carbohydrates  during pregnancy is about 175 to 265 grams per day to fuel fetal  brain development.

All of these changes require adequate  nutrition to ensure development at the appropriate rate.8  Healthy infants grow steadily, but not always at an even pace. For  example, during the first year of life, height increases by 50 percent,  while weight triples. Physicians and other health professionals use  growth charts to track a baby’s development process. Because  infants cannot stand, length is used instead of height to determine  the rate of a child’s growth. Other important developmental  measurements include head circumference and weight. All of these  must be tracked and compared against standard measurements for  an infant’s age.  In the US, for infants and toddlers from birth to 24 months of  age, the WHO growth charts are used to monitor growth. These  standards represent optimal growth for children at this age and  allow for tracking growth trends over time through percentile  rankings. Growth charts may provide warnings that a child has a  medical problem or is malnourished. Growth that is too rapid can  increase the risk for overweight and obesity in childhood and later  in life. Insufficient weight or height gain during infancy may indicate  a condition known as failure-to-thrive (FTT), which is characterized  by poor growth. FTT can happen at any age, but in infancy, it  typically occurs after six months.

Shortly after birth, the expulsion of the  placenta triggers progesterone levels to fall, which activates  lactation.15 When the infant suckles at the breast, levels of the  hormone oxytocin rise to promote the release of breast milk from  the breast when the infant suckles, which is known as the milk- ejection reflex.

A conservative rate of weight loss (1-2 pounds per  week) during lactation does not usually impact the quantity or  quality of breast milk, but maternal deficiencies in some nutrients  have been described during lactation. The nutrient content of  breastmilk does not change much based upon maternal diet for  most nutrients. The RDA for energy is 330 additional Calories during  the first six months of lactation and 400 additional Calories during  the second six months of lactation. The energy needed to support  breastfeeding comes from both increased intake and from stored  fat. For example, during the first six months after her baby is born,  the daily caloric cost for a lactating mother is 500 Calories, with  330 calories derived from increased intake and 170 Calories derived  from maternal fat stores. This helps explain why breastfeeding may  promote weight loss in new mothers.

In addition, breast  milk is rich in cholesterol, which is needed for brain development. It  is helpful to know the different types and components of breastmilk,  along with the nutrients they provide to enable an infant to survive  and thrive.  Colostrum is the milk produced immediately after birth, prior  to the start of mature milk production, and lasts for two to five  days after the arrival of the baby. Cells in the breast can begin to  secrete colostrum by mid-pregnancy. During the last trimester, the  alveoli (grape-like clusters of cells that produce milk) can become  swollen with colostrum. Colostrum is thicker than mature breast  milk, and is yellowish or creamy in color. This protein-rich liquid  fulfills an infant’s nutrient needs during those early days. Although  low in volume, colostrum is packed with concentrated nutrition for  newborns. This special milk is high in fat-soluble vitamins, minerals,  and immunoglobulins (antibodies) that pass from the mother to the  baby. Immunoglobulins provide passive immunity for the newborn  and protect the baby from bacterial and viral diseases.16 Colostrum  also helps the baby to eliminate waste (meconium).  Two to four days after birth, colostrum is replaced by transitional  milk. Nursing the baby early (within the first hour of birth) and  frequently (8 to 14 times per 24 hours) helps to bring in this  increased volume of milk sooner.

Often parents start their babies on soy formula  because they incorrectly assume that soy formula will reduce  allergies and other health problems, but this is not the case.\\xa0 Soy- based formulas are sometimes given to infants who develop  diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, colic, or abdominal pain, but more  often these babies are put on hydrolysate formula to address these  concerns. Hypoallergenic protein hydrolysate formulas are given  to infants who are allergic to cow’s milk and soy protein, or who  have trouble tolerating them. This type of formula uses hydrolyzed  protein, meaning that the protein is broken down into amino acids  and small peptides, which makes it easier to digest, and makes it less  likely to trigger gastrointestinal distress.  Preterm infant formulas are given to premature and low birth  weight infants, if breast milk is unavailable. Preterm infant formulas  have 24 calories per fluid ounce and are given until the infant  reaches a desired weight. These formulas are also higher in protein,  calcium, and phosphorus to meet the special needs of premature  infants.  Infant formula comes in three basic types:  1. Powder that requires mixing with water. This is the least  expensive type of formula.  2. Concentrates, which are liquids that must be diluted with  water. This type is slightly more expensive.  3. Ready-to-use liquids that can be poured directly into bottles.  This is the most expensive type of formula. However, it  requires no preparation. Ready-to-use formulas are used when  a safe and sanitary water supply is not available. Ready-to-use  formulas are also convenient for traveling.  Most babies need about 2.5 ounces of formula per pound of body  weight each day.

Infants should not consume solid foods prior to six months  because most solids are less nutritious than breastmilk. Eating  solids before 6 months of age usually means drinking less breast  milk and is associated with more ear infections and respiratory  infections. If parents try to feed an infant who is too young or is not  ready, their tongue will push the food out; this is called an extrusion  reflex. After six months, the suck-swallow reflexes are not as strong,  and infants can hold up their heads and move them around, both of  which make eating solid foods more feasible.  Solid baby foods can be bought commercially or prepared from  regular food using a food processor, blender, food mill, or grinder at  home. By nine months to a year, infants are able to chew soft foods  and can eat solids that are well chopped or mashed. Infants who are  fed solid foods before 4 months of age are susceptible to developing  food allergies. Therefore, as parents and caregivers introduce solids,  they should feed their child only one new food at a time, to help  identify allergic responses or food intolerances. An iron supplement  is also recommended at this time. Rice is no longer recommended  for a first infant food because of its high arsenic content. When  cereals are introduced, parents can try baby oats or baby wheat.

One is a lack of time. Parents and  other caregivers who are constantly on the go may find it difficult  to fit home-cooked meals into a busy schedule and may turn to  fast food and other conveniences that are quick and easy, but not  nutritionally sound. Another contributing factor is a lack of access  to fresh fruits and vegetables. This is a problem particularly in low- income neighborhoods where local stores and markets may not  stock fresh produce or may have limited options. Physical inactivity  is also a factor, as toddlers who live a sedentary lifestyle are more  likely to be overweight or obese. Another contributor is a lack of  breastfeeding support. Children who were breastfed as infants have  lower rates of obesity than children who were bottle-fed.  To prevent or address toddler obesity parents and caregivers can  do the following:  • Eat at the kitchen table instead of in front of a television to  monitor what and how much a child eats.  • Offer a child healthy portions. The size of a toddler’s fist is an  appropriate serving size.  • Plan time for physical activity, about sixty minutes or more per  day.

Iron-Deficiency Anemia  An infant who switches to solid foods, but does not eat enough  iron-rich foods, can develop iron-deficiency anemia. This condition  occurs when an iron-deprived body cannot produce enough  hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen  throughout the body. The inadequate supply of hemoglobin for new  blood cells results in anemia. Iron-deficiency anemia causes a  number of problems including weakness, pale skin, shortness of  breath, and irritability.

One way to encourage children to eat healthy foods is to make  meal- and snack-time fun and interesting. Parents should include  children in food planning and preparation, for example selecting  items while grocery shopping or helping to prepare part of a meal,  such as making a salad. At this time, parents can also educate  children about kitchen safety. It might be helpful to cut sandwiches,  meats, or pancakes into small or interesting shapes. In addition,  parents should offer nutritious desserts, such as fresh fruits, instead  of calorie-laden cookies, cakes, salty snacks, and ice cream.

In the United States, about 20 percent of households  with children are food insecure to some degree. In half of those,  only adults experience food insecurity, while in the other half both  adults and children are considered to be food insecure, which  means that children did not have access to adequate, nutritious  meals at times.3  Growing up in a food-insecure household can lead to a number  of problems. Deficiencies in iron, zinc, protein, and vitamin A can  result in stunted growth, illness, and limited development. Federal  programs, such as the National School Lunch Program, the School  Breakfast Program, and Summer Feeding Programs, work to address  the risk of hunger and malnutrition in school-aged children. They  help to fill the gaps and provide children living in food-insecure  households with greater access to nutritious meals.  The National School Lunch Program  Beginning with preschool, children consume at least one of their  meals in a school setting. Many children receive both breakfast and  lunch outside of the home. Therefore, it is important for schools  to provide meals that are nutritionally sound.

The Onset of Puberty (Ages 9 through 13 years)  This period of physical development is divided into two phases.  The first phase involves height increases from 20 to 25 percent.  Puberty is second to the prenatal period in terms of rapid growth  as the long bones stretch to their final, adult size. Girls grow 2–8  inches (5–20 centimeters) taller, while boys grow 4–12 inches (10–30  centimeters) taller. The second phase involves weight gain related to  the development of bone, muscle, and fat tissue. Also in the midst of  puberty, the sex hormones trigger the development of reproductive  organs and secondary sexual characteristics, such as pubic hair.  Girls also develop “curves,” while boys become broader and more  muscular.2  Energy and Macronutrients  The energy requirements for preteens differ according to gender,  growth, and activity level.

Because eating disorders often lead to malnourishment,  adolescents with an eating disorder are deprived of the crucial  nutrients their still-growing bodies need.  Eating disorders involve extreme behavior related to food and  exercise. Sometimes referred to as “starving or stuffing,” they  encompass a group of conditions marked by under eating or  overeating. Some of these conditions include:  • Anorexia Nervosa. Anorexia nervosa is a potentially fatal  condition characterized by under eating and excessive weight  loss. People with this disorder are preoccupied with dieting,  calories, and food intake to an unhealthy degree. Anorexics  have a poor body image, which leads to anxiety, avoidance of  food, a rigid exercise regimen, fasting, and a denial of hunger.  The condition predominantly affects females. Between 0.5 and  1 percent of American women and girls suffer from this eating  disorder.  • Binge-Eating Disorder. People who suffer from binge-eating  disorder experience regular episodes of eating an extremely  large amount of food in a short period of time. Binge eating is a  compulsive behavior, and people who suffer from it typically  feel it is beyond their control. This behavior often causes  feelings of shame and embarrassment, and leads to obesity,  high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, Type 2 diabetes,  and other health problems. Both males and females suffer from  binge-eating disorder. It affects 1 to 5 percent of the  3.\\xa0Eating Disorder Statistics.

Rapid weight loss is  not recommended for preteens or younger children due to the risk  of deficiencies and stunted growth.

With the onset of adulthood, good nutrition can help young adults  enjoy an active lifestyle. The body of an adult does not need to  devote its energy and resources to support the rapid growth and  development that characterizes youth. However, the choices made  during those formative years can have a lasting impact.

The  guidelines also recommend that adults eat two 4-ounce servings (or  one 8-ounce serving) of seafood per week.  It is also important to replace proteins that are high in trans  fats and saturated fat with ones that are lower in solid fats and  calories. All adults should limit total fat to 20 to 35 percent of  their daily calories and keep saturated fatty acids to less than 10  percent of total calories by replacing them with monounsaturated  and polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Obesity in Old Age  Similar to other life stages, obesity is a concern for the elderly.  Adults over age sixty are more likely to be obese than young or  middle-aged adults. As explained throughout this chapter, excess  body weight has severe consequences. Being overweight or obese  increases the risk for potentially fatal conditions that can afflict the  elderly.

For older adults who are overweight or obese, dietary changes to  promote weight loss should be combined with an exercise program  to protect muscle mass. This is because dieting reduces muscle as  well as fat, which can exacerbate the loss of muscle mass due to  aging. Although weight loss among the elderly can be beneficial, it  is best to be cautious and consult with a healthcare professional  before beginning a weight-loss program.  4.\\xa0Deaths and Mortality.

A condition known as the  anorexia of aging is characterized by poor food intake, which results  in dangerous weight loss. This major health problem among the  elderly leads to a higher risk for immune deficiency, frequent falls,  muscle loss, and cognitive deficits. Reduced muscle mass and  physical activity mean that older adults need fewer calories per  day to maintain a normal weight. It is important for health care  providers to examine the causes for anorexia of aging among their  patients, which can vary from one individual to another.  Understanding why some elderly people eat less as they age can  help healthcare professionals assess the risk factors associated with  this condition. Decreased intake may be due to disability or the lack  of a motivation to eat. Also, many older adults skip at least one meal  each day. As a result, some elderly people are unable to meet even  reduced energy needs.  Nutritional interventions should focus primarily on a healthy diet.  Remedies can include increasing the frequency of meals and adding  healthy, high-calorie foods (such as nuts, potatoes, whole-grain  pasta, and avocados) to the diet. Liquid supplements between meals  may help to improve caloric intake.5 Health care professionals  should consider a patient’s habits and preferences when developing  a nutritional treatment plan. After a plan is in place, patients should  be weighed on a weekly basis until they show improvement.  5.\\xa0Morley, JE. (1997). Anorexia of Aging: Physiologic and  Pathologic.

Aerobic exercise  increases the ability of muscles to use oxygen for energy  metabolism therefore creating ATP.  Aerobic capacity, or VO2 is the most common standard for  evaluating cardiorespiratory endurance. VO2 max is your maximal  oxygen uptake, and the VO2 max test measures the amount of  oxygen (in relation to body weight) that you can use per minute. A  test subject usually walks or runs on a treadmill or rides a stationary  bicycle while the volume and oxygen content of exhaled air is  measured to determine oxygen consumption as exercise intensity  increases. At some point, the amount of oxygen consumed no longer  increases despite an increase in exercise intensity. This value of  oxygen consumption is referred to as VO2 max, ‘V’ meaning volume,  and ‘max’ meaning the maximum amount of oxygen (O2) an  individual is capable of utilizing. The higher the number, the more  oxygen you can consume, and the faster or longer you can walk, run,  bike, or swim, among other aerobic activities. VO2 max can increase  over time with training.2  Figure 16.1 VO2 Max Test  Physical-Activity- Infographic_UCM_450754_SubHomePage.jsp. Accessed  March 10, 2018.  2.\\xa0Ed Eyestone.

The combination of increased energy  output, energy expenditure and basal needs over a long period of  time can have a major impact on total energy expenditure (see  Figure 16.2 “The Effect of Physical Activity on Energy Expenditure”).  The more energy you expend, the more foods you are able to  consume while maintaining a healthy weight. Any improvement to  metabolic fitness is beneficial and means a decrease in the risk for  developing diabetes, or other chronic conditions.  One measurement of metabolic fitness is basal metabolic rate, or  BMR, which is a measurement of the amount of energy required for  the body to maintain its basic functions while at rest, i.e. breathing,  heart beats, liver and kidney function, and so on. On average, BMR  accounts for between 50 and 70 percent of a person’s total daily  energy expenditure. Different factors can affect the BMR. For  example, a slender person who is tall has more body surface area  and therefore has a higher RMR relative to their body mass (weight).  Also, muscle utilizes more energy at rest than fat, so a person with  more muscle mass has a higher BMR.  A second measurement of metabolic fitness is the number of  calories burned during physical activity. The amount of calories  burned depends on how much oxygen is delivered to tissues, and  how efficiently metabolic reactions consume oxygen and, therefore,  expend calories. One of the best estimates of energy expenditure  during exercise is how much oxygen a person consumes. Recall that  VO2 max is a measure of the maximum cardiorespiratory capacity  to deliver oxygen to the body, especially to working muscles during  exercise.. Greater VO2 max is indicative of better cardiovascular  fitness. In contrast to RMR, VO2 max increases significantly with  exercise training due to training adaptations that increase the  body’s ability to deliver oxygen to working tissues and an increased  capacity of muscles to take up and utilize oxygen.

Even  slightly increased activity can lead to physical benefits, such as:  • Longer life. A regular exercise program can reduce your risk of  dying early from heart disease, certain cancers, and other  leading causes of death.  • Healthier weight. Exercise, along with a healthy, balanced  eating plan, can help you lose extra weight, maintain weight  loss, or prevent excessive weight gain.  • Cardiovascular disease prevention. Being active boosts HDL  cholesterol and decreases unhealthy triglycerides, which  reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases.  • Management of chronic conditions. A regular routine can help  to prevent or manage a wide range of conditions and concerns,  such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, depression,  arthritis, and certain types of cancer.  • Energy boosts. Regular physical activity can improve muscle  tone and strength and provide a boost to your cardiovascular  system. When the heart and lungs work more efficiently, you  have more energy.  • Strong bones.

The stored ATP is able to provide energy for only a few  seconds before it is depleted.

After about 10 seconds, the stored creatine phosphate in the  muscle cells are also depleted as well.  About 15 seconds into exercise, the stored ATP and creatine  phosphate are used up in the muscles.

Anaerobic metabolism can produce ATP at a rapid pace but only  uses glucose as its fuel source. The glucose is obtained from the  blood of muscle glycogen.

The physiology underlying “hitting the wall” means that  muscles have used up all their stored glycogen and are therefore  dependent on other nutrients to support their energy needs. Fatty  acids are transported from fat-storing cells to the muscle to rectify  the nutrient deficit. However, fatty acids take more time to convert  to energy than glucose, thus decreasing performance levels. To  avoid “hitting the wall” or “bonking,” endurance athletes load up  on carbohydrates for a few days before the event, known as  carbohydrate loading. This will maximize an athlete’s amount of  glycogen stored in their liver and muscle tissues. It is important not  to assume that carbohydrate loading works for everyone. Without  accompanied endurance training you will not increase the amount  of stored glucose. If you plan on running a five-mile race for fun  with your friend and decide to eat a large amount of carbohydrates  in the form of a big spaghetti dinner the night before, the excess  carbohydrates will be stored as fat. Therefore, if you are not an  endurance athlete exercising for more than 90 minutes,  carbohydrate loading will provide no benefit, and can even have  some disadvantages. Another way for athletes to avoid “hitting the  wall” is to consume carbohydrate-containing drinks and foods  during an endurance event. In fact, throughout the Tour de  France—a twenty-two-day, twenty-four-hundred-mile race—the  average cyclist consumes greater than 60 grams of carbohydrates  per hour.

However, this open access textbook may be of interest to other courses interested in teaching nutrition through a Hawai‘i- Pacific framed lens.

The foods we eat contain nutrients. Nutrients are substances required by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not synthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure, and/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and reproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body to function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain non-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or beneficial (such as antioxidants). 4 | Introduction',\n",

These can be metabolically processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work, allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories, denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other macronutrients, it does not yield calories.

Non-starchy vegetables also contain carbohydrates, but in lesser quantities. Carbohydrates are broadly classified into two forms based on their chemical structure: simple carbohydrates, often called simple sugars; and complex carbohydrates. Simple carbohydrates consist of one or two basic units. Examples of simple sugars include sucrose, the type of sugar you would have in a bowl on the breakfast table, and glucose, the type of sugar that circulates in your blood.

Glucose is then transported to all our cells where it is stored, used to make energy, or used to build macromolecules. Fiber is also a complex carbohydrate, but it cannot be broken down by digestive enzymes in the human intestine. As a result, it passes through the digestive tract undigested unless the bacteria that inhabit the colon or large intestine break it down. One gram of digestible carbohydrates yields four kilocalories of energy for the cells in the body to perform work. In addition to providing energy and serving as building blocks for bigger macromolecules, carbohydrates are essential for proper functioning of the nervous system, heart, and kidneys. As mentioned, glucose can be stored in the body for future use. In humans, the storage molecule of carbohydrates is called glycogen, and in plants, it is known as starch. Glycogen and starch are complex carbohydrates. Lipids Lipids are also a family of molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but unlike carbohydrates, they are insoluble in water.',\n",

The three main types of lipids are triglycerides (triacylglycerols), phospholipids, and sterols. The main job of lipids is to provide or store energy. Lipids provide more energy per gram than carbohydrates (nine kilocalories per gram of lipids versus four kilocalories per gram of carbohydrates). In addition to energy storage, lipids serve as a major component of cell membranes, surround and protect organs (in fat-storing tissues), provide insulation to aid in temperature regulation, and regulate many other functions in the body. 6 | Introduction',\n",

Amino acids are simple subunits composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Food sources of proteins include meats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of different plant- based foods, most notably soy. The word protein comes from a Greek word meaning “of primary importance,” which is an apt description of these macronutrients; they are also known colloquially as the “workhorses” of life. Proteins provide four kilocalories of energy per gram; however providing energy is not protein’s most important function. Proteins provide structure to bones, muscles and skin, and play a role in conducting most of the chemical reactions that take place in the body. Scientists estimate that greater than one-hundred thousand different proteins exist within the human body. The genetic codes in DNA are basically protein recipes that determine the order in which 20 different amino acids are bound together to make thousands of specific proteins.

Water does not contain carbon, but is composed of two hydrogens and one oxygen per molecule of water. More than 60 percent of your total body weight is water. Without it, nothing could be transported in or out of the body, chemical reactions would not occur, organs would not be cushioned, and body temperature would fluctuate widely. On average, an adult consumes just over two liters of water per day from food and drink combined. Since water is so critical for life’s basic processes, the amount of water input and output is supremely important, a topic we will explore in detail in Chapter 4. Micronutrients Micronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser amounts, but are still essential for carrying out bodily functions. Micronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins. There are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins (See Table 1.1 “Minerals and Their Major Functions” and Table 1.2 “Vitamins and Their Major Functions” for a complete list and their major functions).

A greater discussion of this will follow in subsequent chapters in this book, as there is an enormous amount of information regarding this aspect of lifestyle. Dietary habits include what a person eats, how much a person eats during a meal, how frequently meals are consumed, and how often a person eats out. Other aspects of lifestyle include physical activity level, recreational drug use, and sleeping patterns, all of which play a role in health and impact nutrition.

The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans provides science-based guidance to help Americans aged six and older improve their health through appropriate physical activity.”The guidelines recommend exercise programs for people in many different stages of their lifecycle. The HHS reports that there is strong evidence that increased physical activity decreases the risk of early death, heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and certain cancers; prevents weight gain and falls; and improves cognitive function in the elderly. These guidelines are scheduled for an update in 2018.

To date, science has not been able to track the exact path in the brain that occurs in response to eating a particular food, but it is quite clear that foods, in general, stimulate emotional responses in people. Food also has psychological, cultural, and religious significance, so your personal choices of food affect your mind, as well as your body. The social implications of food have a great deal to do with what people eat, as well as how and when. Special events in individual lives—from birthdays to funerals—are commemorated with equally special foods. Being aware of these forces can help people make healthier food choices—and still honor the traditions and ties they hold dear.

A balanced diet results when you do not consume one nutrient at the expense of another, but rather get appropriate amounts of all nutrients. 3. Calorie control is necessary so that the amount of energy you get from the nutrients you consume equals the amount of energy you expend during your day’s activities. 4.

As an alternative to modern processed foods, a healthy diet focuses on “real” fresh whole foods that have been sustaining people for generations. Whole foods supply the needed vitamins, minerals, protein, carbohydrates, fats, and fiber that are essential to good health. Commercially prepared and fast foods are often lacking nutrients and often contain inordinate amounts of sugar, salt, saturated and trans fats, all of which are associated with the development of diseases such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke, cancer, obesity, diabetes, and other illnesses.

Nutrient-dense foods are the opposite of “empty-calorie” foods, such as sugary carbonated beverages, which are also called “nutrient-poor.”Nutrient-dense foods include fruits and vegetables, lean meats, poultry, fish, low-fat dairy products, and whole grains. Choosing more nutrient-dense foods will facilitate weight loss, while simultaneously providing all necessary nutrients. Balance Balance the foods in your diet. Achieving balance in your diet entails not consuming one nutrient at the expense of another. For example, calcium is essential for healthy teeth and bones, but too much calcium will interfere with iron absorption. Most foods that are good sources of iron are poor sources of calcium, so in order to get the necessary amounts of calcium and iron from your diet, a proper balance between food choices is critical.

To carry out this isolation, he burned some seaweed and in the process, observed an intense violet vapor that crystallized when he exposed it to a cold surface. He sent the violet crystals to an expert on gases, Joseph Gay-Lussac, who identified the crystal as a new element. It was named iodine, the Greek word for violet. The following scientific record is some of what took place in order to conclude that iodine is a nutrient. Observation. Eating seaweed is a cure for goiter, a gross enlargement of the thyroid gland in the neck. Hypothesis. In 1813, Swiss physician Jean-Francois Coindet hypothesized that the seaweed contained iodine, and that iodine could be used instead of seaweed to treat his patients1. 1.',\n",

Around the world, other cultures had similar views of food and its relationship with health. A famous quote by the Greek physician Hippocrates over two thousand years ago, “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food” bear much relevance on our food choices and their connection to our health. Today, the scientific community echoes Hippocrates’ statement as it recognizes some foods as functional foods. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics defines functional foods as “whole foods and fortified, enriched, or enhanced foods that have a potentially beneficial effect on health when consumed as part of a varied diet on a regular basis, at effective levels.” In the latter nineteenth century, a Russian doctor of immunology, Elie Metchnikoff, was intrigued by the healthy life spans of people who lived in the tribes of the northern Caucasus Mountains. What contributed to their long lifespan and their resistance to life- threatening diseases?A possible factor lay wrapped up in a leather satchel used to hold fermented milk. Observing the connection between the beverage and longevity, Dr. Elie Metchnikoff began his research on beneficial bacteria and the longevity of life that led to his book, The Prolongation of Life. He studied the biological effects and chemical properties of the kefir elixir whose name came from the Turkish word “kef” or “pleasure.”',\n",

While some health claims remain unsubstantiated, scientific studies are ongoing to determine the validity of other health benefits of probiotics. The Native Hawaiians also consumed a daily probiotic in their diet commonly known as poi (pounded taro). In precolonial Hawai‘i, poi was used for a wide variety of dietary and medicinal purposes. Aside from poi’s nutrient dense composition, fermented poi has numerous compounds created in the fermentation process that are very beneficial to the health of the human body. As a probiotic, evidence suggests that poi can be useful in helping diseases such as diarrhea, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer.1 Another well-known probiotic to the local people of Hawai‘i is Kimchi.

When you feel hungry, your body sends a message to your brain that it is time to eat. Sights and smells influence your body’s preparedness for food. Smelling food sends a message to your brain. Your brain then tells the mouth to get ready, and you start to salivate in preparation for a meal. Once you have eaten, your digestive system (Figure 2.4 “The Human Digestive System”) starts the process that breaks down the components of food into smaller components that can be absorbed and taken into the body. To do this, the digestive system functions on two levels, mechanically to move and mix ingested food and chemically to break down large molecules. The smaller nutrient molecules can then be absorbed and processed by cells throughout the body for energy or used as building blocks for new cells. The digestive system is one of the eleven organ systems of the human body, and it is composed of several hollow tube-shaped organs including the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine (colon), rectum, and anus. It is lined with mucosal tissue that secretes digestive juices (which aid in the breakdown of food) and mucus (which facilitates the propulsion of food through the tract).',\n",

The first step is ingestion, which is the intake of food into the digestive tract. It may seem a simple process, but ingestion involves smelling food, thinking about food, and the involuntary release of saliva in the mouth to prepare for food entry. In the mouth, where the second step of digestion starts, the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins. The chemical breakdown of food involves enzymes, such as salivary amylase that starts the breakdown of large starch molecules into smaller components. Mechanical breakdown starts with mastication (chewing) in the mouth. Teeth crush and grind large food particles, while saliva provides lubrication and enables food movement downward. The slippery mass of partially broken-down food is called a bolus, which moves down the digestive tract as you swallow. Swallowing may seem voluntary at first because it requires conscious effort to push the food with the tongue back toward the throat, but after this, swallowing proceeds involuntarily, meaning it cannot be stopped 72 | The Digestive System',\n",

As you swallow, the bolus is pushed from the mouth through the pharynx and into a muscular tube called the esophagus. As the bolus travels through the pharynx, a small flap called the epiglottis closes to prevent choking by keeping food from going into the trachea. Peristaltic contractions also known as peristalsis in the esophagus propel the food bolus down to the stomach (Figure 3.6 “Peristalsis in the Esophagus”). At the junction between the esophagus and stomach there is a sphincter muscle that remains closed until the food bolus approaches. The pressure of the food bolus stimulates the lower esophageal sphincter to relax and open and food then moves from the esophagus into the stomach. The mechanical breakdown of food is accentuated by the muscular contractions of the stomach and small intestine that mash, mix, slosh, and propel food down the alimentary canal. Solid food takes between four and eight seconds to travel down the esophagus, and liquids take about one second. Figure 2.6 Peristalsis in the Esophagus The Digestive System | 73',\n",

Chyme is a semiliquid mass of partially digested food that also contains gastric juices secreted by cells in the stomach. These gastric juices contain hydrochloric acid and the enzyme pepsin, that chemically start breakdown of the protein components of food. The length of time food spends in the stomach varies by the macronutrient composition of the meal. A high-fat or high-protein meal takes longer to break down than one rich in carbohydrates. It usually takes a few hours after a meal to empty the stomach contents completely into the small intestine. The small intestine is divided into three structural parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. Once the chyme enters the duodenum (the first segment of the small intestine), the pancreas and gallbladder are stimulated and release juices that aid in digestion. The pancreas secretes up to 1.5 liters (.4 US gallons) of pancreatic juice through a duct into the duodenum per day. This fluid consists mostly of water, but it also contains bicarbonate ions that neutralize the acidity of the stomach-derived chyme and enzymes that further break down proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids.',\n",

Any food that is still incompletely broken down (usually less than ten percent of food consumed) and the food’s indigestible fiber content move from the small intestine to the large intestine (colon) through a connecting valve. A main task of the large intestine is to absorb much of the remaining water. Remember, water is present not only in solid foods and beverages, but also the stomach releases a few hundred milliliters of gastric juice, and the pancreas adds approximately 500 milliliters during the digestion of the meal. For the body to conserve water, it is important that excessive water is not lost in fecal matter. In the large intestine, no further chemical or mechanical breakdown of food takes place unless it is accomplished by the bacteria that inhabit this portion of the intestinal tract. The number of bacteria residing in the large intestine is estimated to be greater than 1014, which is more than the total number of cells in the human body (1013).

Metabolic homeostasis is achieved when the nutrients consumed and absorbed match the energy required to carry out life’s biological processes. Simply put, nutrient energy intake equals energy output.

The lymphatic system slowly moves its contents through the lymphatic vessels and empties into blood vessels in the upper chest area.

Nutrient levels and the hormones that respond to their levels in the blood provide the input so that the liver can distinguish between the fasted and fed states and distribute nutrients appropriately.

Neurons form the core of the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and other nerve bundles in the body. The main function of the central nervous system is to sense changes in the external environment and create a reaction to them. For instance, if your finger comes into contact with a thorn on a rose bush, a sensory neuron transmits a signal from your finger up through the spinal cord and into the brain. Another neuron in the brain sends a signal that travels back to the muscles in your hand and stimulates muscles to contract and you jerk your finger away. All of this happens within a tenth of a second. All nerve impulses travel by the movement of charged sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride atoms. Nerves communicate with each other via chemicals built from amino acids called neurotransmitters. Eating adequate protein from a variety of sources will ensure the body gets all of the different amino acids that are important for central nervous system function.

Just as too much glucose is bad for other organs, such as the kidneys and pancreas, it also produces negative effects upon the brain. Excessive glucose levels in the blood can cause a loss of cognitive function, and chronically high blood-glucose levels can damage brain cells. The brain’s cognitive functions include language processing, learning, perceiving, and thinking. Recent scientific studies demonstrate that having continuously high blood- glucose levels substantially elevates the risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease, which is the greatest cause of age-related cognitive decline. The good news is that much research is directed toward determining the best diets and foods that slow cognitive decline and maximize brain health. A study in the June 2010 issue of the Archives of Neurology reports that people over age 65 who adhered to diets that consisted of higher intakes of nuts, fish, poultry, tomatoes, cruciferous vegetables, fruits, salad dressing, and dark green, and leafy vegetables, as well as a lower intake of high-fat dairy products, red meat, organ meat, and butter, had a much reduced risk for Alzheimer’s disease.1 Other scientific studies provide supporting evidence that foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids and/or antioxidants provide the brain with protection against Alzheimer’s disease. One potential “brain food” is the blueberry. The protective effects of blueberries upon the brain are linked to their high content of anthocyanins, which are potent antioxidants and reduce inflammation.

This is because cells need to maintain oxidative metabolism for energy production that continuously regenerates adenosine triphosphate (ATP). For oxidative phosphorylation to occur, oxygen is used as a reactant and carbon dioxide is released as a waste product. You may be surprised to learn that although oxygen is a critical need for cells, it is actually the accumulation of carbon dioxide that primarily drives your need to breathe. Carbon dioxide is exhaled and oxygen is inhaled through the respiratory system, which includes muscles to move air into and out of the lungs, passageways through which air moves, and microscopic gas exchange surfaces covered by capillaries. The cardiovascular system transports gases from the lungs to tissues throughout the body and vice versa. A variety of diseases can affect the respiratory system, such as asthma, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), and lung cancer. All of these conditions affect the gas exchange process and result in labored breathing and other difficulties. The major organs of the respiratory system function primarily to provide oxygen to body tissues for cellular respiration, remove the waste product carbon dioxide, and help to maintain acid-base balance. Portions of the respiratory system are also used for non- vital functions, such as sensing odors, producing speech, and for straining, such as during childbirth or coughing.',\n",

These cells are called “insulin-resistant.”Insulin is released after a meal and instructs the liver and other tissues to take up glucose and fatty acids that are circulating in the blood. When cells are resistant to insulin they do not take up enough glucose and fatty acids, so glucose and fatty acids remain at high concentrations in the blood. The chronic elevation of glucose and fatty acids in the blood also causes damage to other tissues over time, so that people who have Type 2 diabetes are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, nerve damage, and eye disease.

It consists of over six hundred skeletal muscles, as well as the heart muscle, the smooth muscles that surround your entire alimentary canal, and all your arterial blood vessels (see Figure 2.24 “The Muscular System in the Human Body”). Muscle contraction relies on energy delivery to the muscle. Each movement uses up cellular energy, and without an adequate energy supply, muscle function suffers. Muscle, like the liver, can store the energy from glucose in the large polymeric molecule glycogen. But unlike the liver, muscles use up all of their own stored energy and do not export it to other organs in the body. Muscle is not as susceptible to low levels of blood glucose as the brain because it will readily use alternate fuels such as fatty acids and protein to produce cellular energy.

In fact, in the first year of life, almost 100 percent of the bone tissue in the skeleton is replaced. In the process of modeling, bone tissue is dismantled at one site and built up at a different site. In adulthood, our bones stop growing and modeling, but continue to go through a process of bone remodeling. In the process of remodeling, bone tissue is degraded and built up at the same location. About 10 percent of bone tissue is remodeled each year in adults. Bones adapt their structure to the forces acting upon them, even in adulthood.

Osteoclasts are large cells with a highly irregular ruffled membrane. These cells fuse tightly to the bone and secrete hydrogen ions, which acidify the local environment and dissolve the minerals in the bone tissue matrix.

In this stage, sugars and proteins accumulate along the bone’s surface, forming a cement line which acts to form a strong bond between the old bone and the new bone that will be made.

In the last step of bone remodeling, osteoblasts lay down new osteoid tissue that fills up the cavities that were excavated during the resorption process.

The major physical factors contributing to body weight are water weight, muscle tissue mass, bone tissue mass, and fat tissue mass. Overweight refers to having more weight than normal for a particular height and may be the result of water weight, muscle weight, or fat mass. Obese refers specifically to having excess body fat. In most cases people who are overweight also have excessive body fat and therefore body weight is an indicator of obesity in much of the population. The “ideal” healthy body weight for a particular person is dependent on many things, such as frame size, sex, muscle mass, bone density, age, and height. The perception of the “ideal” body weight is additionally dependent on cultural factors and the mainstream societal advertisement of beauty. To standardize the “ideal” body weight and relate it to health, scientists have devised mathematical formulas to better define a healthy weight.

BMI Limitations A BMI is a fairly simple measurement and does not take into account fat mass or fat distribution in the body, both of which are additional predictors of disease risk. Body fat weighs less than muscle mass. Therefore, BMI can sometimes underestimate the amount of body fat in overweight or obese people and overestimate it in more muscular people. For instance, a muscular athlete will have more muscle mass (which is heavier than fat mass) than a sedentary individual of the same height. Based on their BMIs the muscular athlete would be less “ideal” and may be categorized as more overweight or obese than the sedentary individual; however this is an infrequent problem with BMI calculation. Additionally, an older person with osteoporosis (decreased bone mass) will have a lower BMI than an older person of the same height without osteoporosis, even though the person with osteoporosis may have more fat mass. BMI is a useful inexpensive tool to categorize people and is highly correlative with disease risk, but other measurements are needed to diagnose obesity and more accurately assess disease risk.',\n",

Having more fat mass may be indicative of disease risk, but fat mass also varies with sex, age, and physical activity level. Females have more fat mass, which is needed for reproduction and, in part, is a consequence of different levels of hormones. The optimal fat content of a female is between 20 and 30 percent of her total weight and for a male is between 12 and 20 percent. Fat mass can be measured in a variety of ways. The simplest and lowest- cost way is the skin-fold test. A health professional uses a caliper to measure the thickness of skin on the back, arm, and other parts of the body and compares it to standards to assess body fatness. It is a noninvasive and fairly accurate method of measuring fat mass, but similar to BMI, is compared to standards of mostly young to middle- aged adults.',\n",

Fat can be found in different areas in the body and it does not all act the same, meaning it differs physiologically based on location.

The processes involved keep fluids from becoming too dilute or too concentrated. Fluid compartments are separated by selectively permeable membranes, which allow some things, such as water, to move through while other substances require special transport proteins, channels, and often energy. The movement of water between fluid compartments happens by osmosis, which is simply the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane from an area where it is highly concentrated to an area where it is not so concentrated. Water is never transported actively; that is, it never takes energy for water to move between compartments. Although cells do not directly control water movement, they do control movement of electrolytes and other solutes and thus indirectly regulate water movement by controlling where there will be regions of high and low concentrations. Cells maintain their water volume at a constant level, but the composition of solutes in a cell is in a continuous state of flux. This is because cells are bringing nutrients in, metabolizing them, and disposing of waste products.

If a cell is placed in a solution that contains fewer dissolved particles (hypotonic solution) than the cell itself, water moves into the more concentrated cell, causing it to swell. Alternatively, if a cell is placed in a solution that is more concentrated (known as a hypertonic solution) water moves from inside the cell to the outside, causing it to shrink. Cells keep their water volume constant by pumping electrolytes in and out in an effort to balance the concentrations of dissolved particles on either side of their membranes.

Of all the nutrients, water is the most critical as its absence proves lethal within a few days. Organisms have adapted numerous mechanisms for water conservation.

Water As a Transportation Vehicle Water is called the “universal solvent” because more substances dissolve in it than any other fluid. Molecules dissolve in water because of the hydrogen and oxygen molecules ability to loosely bond with other molecules. Molecules of water (H2O) surround substances, suspending them in a sea of water molecules. The solvent action of water allows for substances to be more readily transported. A pile of undissolved salt would be difficult to move throughout tissues, as would a bubble of gas or a glob of fat. Blood, the primary transport fluid in the body is about 78 percent water. Dissolved substances in blood include proteins, lipoproteins, glucose, electrolytes, and metabolic waste products, such as carbon dioxide and urea. These substances are either dissolved in the watery surrounding of blood to be transported to cells to support basic functions or are removed from cells to prevent waste build- up and toxicity. Blood is not just the primary vehicle of transport in the body, but also as a fluid tissue blood structurally supports blood vessels that would collapse in its absence.',\n",

Why then, does the water not flow from blood plasma to cells?The force of water also known as hydrostatic pressure maintains the volumes of water between fluid compartments against the force of all dissolved substances. The concentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water. (Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between the intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration of all dissolved substances is equal.) The force driving the water movement through the selectively permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the one side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a selectively permeable membrane exert a force, called osmotic pressure. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an equal rate). One equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different volumes is the following 5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L = 5g/L) The differences in concentrations of particular substances provide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work.',\n",

In contrast to many minerals, sodium absorption in the small intestine is extremely efficient and in a healthy individual all excess sodium is excreted by the kidneys. In fact, very little sodium is required in the diet (about 200 milligrams) because the kidneys actively reabsorb sodium. Kidney reabsorption of sodium is hormonally controlled, allowing for a relatively constant sodium concentration in the blood. Other Functions of Sodium in the Body The second notable function of sodium is in nerve impulse transmission. Nerve impulse transmission results from the transport of sodium cations into a nerve cell, which creates a charge difference (or voltage) between the nerve cell and its extracellular environment. Similar to how a current moves along a wire, a sodium current moves along a nerve cell. Stimulating a muscle contraction also involves the movement of sodium ions as well as other ion movements. Sodium is essential for nutrient absorption in the small intestine and also for nutrient reabsorption in the kidney. Amino acids, glucose and water must make their way from the small intestine to the blood.',\n",

Sweat is mostly water but also contains some electrolytes, mostly sodium and chloride. Under normal environmental conditions (i.e., not hot, humid days) water and sodium loss through sweat is negligible, but is highly variable among individuals. It is estimated that sixty minutes of high-intensity physical activity, like playing a game of tennis, can produce approximately one liter of sweat; however the amount of sweat produced is highly dependent on environmental conditions. A liter of sweat typically contains between 1 and 2 grams of sodium and therefore exercising for multiple hours can result in a high amount of sodium loss in some people. Additionally, hard labor can produce substantial sodium loss through sweat. In either case, the lost sodium is easily replaced in the next snack or meal. In athletes hyponatremia, or a low blood-sodium level, is not so much the result of excessive sodium loss in sweat, but rather drinking too much water. The excess water dilutes the sodium concentration in blood. Illnesses causing vomiting, sweating, and diarrhea may also cause hyponatremia.',\n",

Sports drinks are better at restoring fluid and blood-glucose levels than replacing electrolytes. During an endurance event you would be better off drinking water and eating an energy bar that contains sugars, proteins, and electrolytes. The American College of Sports Medicine suggests if you are exercising for longer than one hour you eat one high carbohydrate (25–40 grams) per hour of exercise along with ample water.1 Watch out for the fat content, as sometimes energy bars contain a hefty dose. If you’re not exercising over an hour at high intensity, you can skip the sports drinks, but not the water. For those who do not exercise or do so at low to moderate intensity, sports drinks are another source of extra calories, sugar, and salt. Needs and Dietary Sources of Sodium The IOM has set an AI level for sodium for healthy adults between the ages of nineteen and fifty at 1,500 milligrams (Table 3.2 “Dietary Reference Intakes for Sodium”). Table salt is approximately 40 percent sodium and 60 percent chloride. As a reference point, only ⅔ teaspoon of salt is needed in the diet to meet the AI for sodium.

The UL is considered appropriate for healthy individuals but not those with hypertension (high blood pressure). The IOM estimates that greater than 95 percent of men and 75 percent of women in America consume salt in excess of the UL. Many scientific studies demonstrate that reducing salt intake prevents hypertension, is helpful in reducing blood pressure after hypertension is diagnosed, and reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease. The IOM recommends that people over fifty, African Americans, diabetics, and those with chronic kidney disease should consume no more than 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day. The American Heart Association (AHA) states that all Americans, not just those listed, should consume less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day to prevent cardiovascular disease.

In addition to passively following sodium, chloride has its own protein channels that reside in cell membranes. These protein channels are especially abundant in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and lungs. Chloride’s Role in Fluid Balance Chloride aids in fluid balance mainly because it follows sodium in order to maintain charge neutrality. Chloride channels also play a role in regulating fluid secretion, such as pancreatic juice into the small intestine and the flow of water into mucus. Fluid secretion and mucus are important for many of life’s processes. Their importance is exemplified in the signs and symptoms of the genetic disease, cystic fibrosis. Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most prevalent inherited diseases in people of European descent. It is caused by a mutation in a protein that transports chloride ions out of the cell. CF’s signs and symptoms include salty skin, poor digestion and absorption (leading to poor growth), sticky mucus accumulation in the lungs (causing increased susceptibility to respiratory infections), liver damage, and infertility.',\n",

Other mineral salts, such as magnesium chloride, are not absorbed as well, but bioavailability still remains high.

Ninety percent of potassium exists in intracellular fluid, with about 10 percent in extracellular fluid, and only 1 percent in blood plasma. As with sodium, potassium levels in the blood are strictly regulated. The hormone aldosterone is what primarily controls potassium levels, but other hormones (such as insulin) also play a role. When potassium levels in the blood increase, the adrenal glands release aldosterone. The aldosterone acts on the collecting ducts of kidneys, where it stimulates an increase in the number of sodium-potassium pumps. Sodium is then reabsorbed and more potassium is excreted. Because potassium is required for maintaining sodium levels, and hence fluid balance, about 200 milligrams of potassium are lost from the body every day. Other Functions of Potassium in the Body Nerve impulse involves not only sodium, but also potassium. A nerve impulse moves along a nerve via the movement of sodium ions into the cell.',\n",

Imbalances of Potassium Insufficient potassium levels in the body (hypokalemia) can be caused by a low dietary intake of potassium or by high sodium intakes, but more commonly it results from medications that increase water excretion, mainly diuretics. The signs and symptoms of hypokalemia are related to the functions of potassium in nerve cells and consequently skeletal and smooth-muscle contraction. The signs and symptoms include muscle weakness and cramps, respiratory distress, and constipation. Severe potassium depletion can cause the heart to have abnormal contractions and can even be fatal. High levels of potassium in the blood, or hyperkalemia, also affects the heart. It is a silent condition as it often displays no signs or symptoms. Extremely high levels of potassium in the blood disrupt the electrical impulses that stimulate the heart and can cause the heart to stop. Hyperkalemia is usually the result of kidney dysfunction.

Water intoxication is extremely rare, primarily because healthy kidneys are capable of excreting up to one liter of excess water per hour.

Physiologically, dehydration decreases blood volume. The water in cells moves into the blood to compensate for the low blood-volume, and cells shrink. Signs and symptoms of dehydration include thirst, dizziness, fainting, headaches, low blood-pressure, fatigue, low to no urine output, and, in extreme cases, loss of consciousness and death. Signs and symptoms are usually noticeable after about 2 percent of total body water is lost. Chronic dehydration is linked to higher incidences of some diseases.

This is 7 percent higher than the IOM acceptable caloric intake from beverages. Moreover, the high intakes of soft drinks and sugary beverages displace the intake of more nutrient-dense beverages, such as low-fat milk. Scientific studies have demonstrated that while all beverages are capable of satisfying thirst they do not make you feel full, or satiated. This means that drinking a calorie-containing beverage with a meal only provides more calories, as it won’t be offset by eating less food. The Beverage Panel of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill has taken on the challenge of scientifically evaluating the health benefits and risks of beverage groups and providing recommendations for beverage groups (Table 3.10 “Recommendations of the Beverage Panel”). In regards to soft drinks and fruit drinks, The Beverage Panel states that they increase energy intake, are not satiating, and that there is little if any reduction in other foods to compensate for the excess calories.

These processes aim to remove unhealthy substances and produce high-quality, colorless, odorless, good-tasting water. Most drinking water is disinfected by the process of chlorination, which involves adding chlorine compounds to the water. Chlorination is cheap and effective at killing bacteria. However, it is less effective at removing protozoa, such as Giardia lamblia. Chlorine-resistant protozoa and viruses are instead removed by extensive filtration methods.

How does caffeine stimulate the brain?Caffeine is chemically similar to a chemical in our brains (adenosine). Caffeine interacts with adenosine’s specific protein receptor. It blocks the actions of the adenosine, and affects the levels of signaling molecules in the brain, leading to an increase in energy metabolism. At the molecular level, caffeine stimulates the brain, increasing alertness and causing a delay of fatigue and sleep. At high doses caffeine stimulates the motor cortex of the brain and interferes with the sleep-wake cycle, causing side effects such as shakiness, anxiety, and insomnia.',\n",

Although the effect of caffeine on calcium excretion is small, postmenopausal women with risk factors for osteoporosis may want to make sure their dietary caffeine intake is low or moderate and not excessive. The Caffeine Myth A diuretic refers to any substance that elevates the normal urine output above that of drinking water. Caffeinated beverages are commonly believed to be dehydrating due to their diuretic effect, but results from scientific studies do not support that caffeinated beverages increase urine output more so than water. This does not mean that consuming caffeinated beverages does not affect urine output, but rather that it does not increase urine output more than water does. Thus, caffeinated beverages are considered a source of hydration similar to water.

The sugar is helpful in maintaining blood- glucose levels needed to fuel muscles, the water keeps an athlete hydrated, and the sodium enhances fluid absorption and replaces some of that lost in sweat. The American College of Sports Medicine states that the goal of drinking fluids during exercise is to prevent dehydration, which compromises performance and endurance. The primary source of water loss during intense physical activity is sweat. Perspiration rates are variable and dependent on many factors including body composition, humidity, temperature, and type of exercise. The hydration goal for obtaining optimal endurance and performance is to replace what is lost, not to over- hydrate. A person’s sweating rate can be approximated by measuring weight before and after exercise—the difference in weight will be the amount of water weight you lost.

Children and adult athletes exercising for more than one hour at high-intensity (tennis, rowing, rugby, soccer, etc.)may benefit endurance-wise and possibly performance-wise from consuming a sports drink rather than water. However, consuming sports drinks provides no benefit over water to endurance, performance, or exercise recovery for those exercising less than an hour. In fact, as with all other sugary drinks containing few to no nutrients, they are only another source of calories. Drinking sports drinks when you are doing no exercise at all is not recommended. Sports Drink Alternatives Instead of a sports drink, you can replenish lost fluids and obtain energy and electrolytes during exercise by drinking plain water and eating a sports bar or snack that contains carbohydrates, protein, and electrolytes. Post-exercise, low-fat milk has been scientifically shown to be just as effective as a sports drink as a rehydration beverage and it is more nutrient-dense, containing carbohydrates, protein, and electrolytes, in addition to other vitamins.

Saliva contains the enzyme, salivary amylase. This enzyme breaks the bonds between the monomeric sugar units of disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and starches. The salivary amylase breaks down amylose and amylopectin into smaller chains of glucose, called dextrins and maltose. The increased concentration of maltose in the mouth that results from the mechanical and chemical breakdown of starches in whole grains is what enhances their sweetness.

A typical American Thanksgiving meal contains many foods that are dense in carbohydrates, with the majority of those being simple sugars and starches. These types of carbohydrate foods are rapidly digested and absorbed. Blood glucose levels rise quickly causing a spike in insulin levels. Contrastingly, foods containing high amounts of fiber are like time-release capsules of sugar. A measurement of the effects of a carbohydrate-containing food on blood-glucose levels is called the glycemic response. Glycemic Index The glycemic responses of various foods have been measured and then ranked in comparison to a reference food, usually a slice of white bread or just straight glucose, to create a numeric value called the glycemic index (GI). Foods that have a low GI do not raise blood- glucose levels neither as much nor as fast as foods that have a higher GI. A diet of low-GI foods has been shown in epidemiological and clinical trial studies to increase weight loss and reduce the risk of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.2 2.

The type of carbohydrate within a food affects the GI along with its fat and fiber content. Increased fat and fiber in foods increases the time required for digestion and delays the rate of gastric emptying into the small intestine which, ultimately reduces the GI. Processing and cooking also affects a food’s GI by increasing their digestibility. Advancements in the technologies of food processing and the high consumer demand for convenient, precooked foods in the United States has created foods that are digested and absorbed more rapidly, independent of the fiber content. Modern breakfast cereals, breads, pastas, and many prepared foods have a high GI. In contrast, most raw foods have a lower GI. (However, the more ripened a fruit or vegetable is, the higher its GI.) The GI can be used as a guide for choosing healthier carbohydrate choices but has some limitations.

They are energy production, energy storage, building macromolecules, sparing protein, and assisting in lipid metabolism. Energy Production The primary role of carbohydrates is to supply energy to all cells in the body. Many cells prefer glucose as a source of energy versus other compounds like fatty acids. Some cells, such as red blood cells, are only able to produce cellular energy from glucose. The brain is also highly sensitive to low blood-glucose levels because it uses only glucose to produce energy and function (unless under extreme starvation conditions). About 70 percent of the glucose entering the body from digestion is redistributed (by the liver) back into the blood for use by other tissues. Cells that require energy remove the glucose from the blood with a transport protein in their membranes. The energy from glucose comes from the chemical bonds between the carbon atoms. Sunlight energy was required to produce these high-energy bonds in the process of photosynthesis.',\n",

The amount of glycogen in the body at any one time is equivalent to about 4,000 kilocalories—3,000 in muscle tissue and 1,000 in the liver. Prolonged muscle use (such as exercise for longer than a few hours) can deplete the glycogen energy reserve. Remember that this is referred to as “hitting the wall” or “bonking” and is characterized by fatigue and a decrease in exercise performance. The weakening of muscles sets in because it takes longer to transform the chemical energy in fatty acids and proteins to usable energy than glucose. After prolonged exercise, glycogen is gone and muscles must rely more on lipids and proteins as an energy source. Athletes can increase their glycogen reserve modestly by reducing training intensity and increasing their carbohydrate intake to between 60 and 70 percent of total calories three to five days prior to an event. People who are not hardcore training and choose to run a 5-kilometer race for fun do not need to consume a big plate of pasta prior to a race since without long-term intense training the adaptation of increased muscle glycogen will not happen. The liver, like muscle, can store glucose energy as a glycogen, but in contrast to muscle tissue it will sacrifice its stored glucose energy to other tissues in the body when blood glucose is low.

Many scientific studies demonstrate positive correlations between diets high in added sugars with weight gain and disease risk, but some others do not show a significant relationship.

The Most Notorious Sugar Before high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) was marketed as the best food and beverage sweetener, sucrose (table sugar) was the number-one sweetener in America. (Recall that sucrose, or table sugar, is a disaccharide consisting of one glucose unit and one fructose unit.)HFCS also contains the simple sugars fructose and glucose, but with fructose at a slightly higher concentration. In the production of HFCS, corn starch is broken down to glucose, and some of the glucose is then converted to fructose. Fructose is sweeter than glucose; hence many food manufacturers choose to sweeten foods with HFCS. HFCS is used as a sweetener for carbonated beverages, condiments, cereals, and a great variety of other processed foods. Some scientists, public health personnel, and healthcare providers believe that fructose is the cause of the obesity epidemic and its associated health consequences. The majority of their evidence stems from the observation that since the early 1970s the number of overweight or obese Americans has dramatically increased and so has the consumption of foods containing HFCS. However, as discussed, so has the consumption of added sugars in general.',\n",

In human studies, excessive fructose intake has sometimes been associated with weight gain, but results are inconsistent. Moderate fructose intake is not associated with weight gain at all. Moreover, other studies show that some fructose in the diet actually improves glucose metabolism especially in people with Type 2 diabetes.5 In fact, people with diabetes were once advised to use fructose as an alternative sweetener to table sugar. Overall, there is no good evidence that moderate fructose consumption contributes to weight gain and chronic disease. At this time conclusive evidence is not available on whether fructose is any worse than any other added sugar in increasing the risk for obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Do Low-Carbohydrate Diets Affect Health? Since the early 1990s, marketers of low-carbohydrate diets have bombarded us with the idea that eating fewer carbohydrates promotes weight loss and that these diets are superior to others in their effects on weight loss and overall health. The most famous of these low-carbohydrate diets is the Atkins diet. Others include the “South Beach” diet, the “Zone” diet, and the “Earth” diet.',\n",

Now that we know the benefits of eating the right carbohydrate, we will examine exactly how much should be eaten to promote health and prevent disease. How Many Carbohydrates Does a Person Need? The Food and Nutrition Board of IOM has set the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of carbohydrates for children and adults at 130 grams per day. This is the average minimum amount the brain requires to function properly. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for carbohydrates is between 45 and 65 percent of your total caloric daily intake. This means that on a 2,000 kilocalorie diet, a person should consume between 225 and 325 grams of carbohydrate each day. According to the IOM not more than 25 percent of total calories consumed should come from added sugars. The World Health Organization and the AHA recommend much lower intakes of added sugars—10 percent or less of total calories consumed. The IOM has also set Adequate Intakes for dietary fiber, which are 38 and 25 grams for men and women, respectively.',\n",

It’s the Whole Nutrient Package In choosing dietary sources of carbohydrates the best ones are those that are nutrient dense, meaning they contain more essential nutrients per calorie of energy. In general, nutrient-dense carbohydrates are minimally processed and include whole-grain breads and cereals, low-fat dairy products, fruits, vegetables, and beans. In contrast, empty-calorie carbohydrate foods are highly processed and often contain added sugars and fats. Soft drinks, cakes, cookies, and candy are examples of empty-calorie carbohydrates. They are sometimes referred to as ‘bad carbohydrates,’ as they are known to cause health problems when consumed in excess. Understanding Carbohydrates from Product Information While nutrition facts labels aid in determining the amount of carbohydrates you eat, they do not help in determining whether a food is refined or not. The ingredients list provides some help in this regard. It identifies all of the food’s ingredients in order of concentration, with the most concentrated ingredient first.

The differences in chemical structure between the different carbohydrates confer their varied functional uses in foods. Starches, gums, and pectins are used as thickening agents in making jam, cakes, cookies, noodles, canned products, imitation cheeses, and a variety of other foods. Molecular gastronomists use slow- releasing carbohydrates, such as alginate, to give shape and texture to their fascinating food creations. Adding fiber to foods increases bulk.

Artificial sweeteners are basically non-nutrients though not all are completely calorie-free. However, because they are so intense in sweetness they are added in very small amounts to foods and beverages. Artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols are not “fermentable sugars” and therefore they do not cause tooth decay. Chewing gum with artificial sweeteners is the only proven way that artificial sweeteners promote oral health. The American Dental Association (ADA) allows manufacturers of chewing gum to label packages with an ADA seal if they have convincing scientific evidence demonstrating their product either reduces plaque acids, cavities, or gum disease, or promotes tooth remineralization. There is limited scientific evidence that consuming products with artificial sweeteners decreases weight. In fact, some studies suggest the intense sweetness of these products increases appetite for sweet foods and may lead to increased weight gain. Also, there is very limited evidence that suggests artificial sweeteners lower blood-glucose levels. Additionally, many foods and beverages containing artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols are still empty- calorie foods (i.e. chewing sugarless gum or drinking diet soda pop) are not going to better your blood-glucose levels or your health.',\n",

In the early 1970s scientific studies were published that demonstrated that high doses of saccharin caused bladder tumors in rats. This information fueled the still-ongoing debate of the health consequences of all artificial sweeteners. In actuality, the results from the early studies were completely irrelevant to humans. The large doses (2.5 percent of diet) of saccharine caused a pellet to form in the rat’s bladder. That pellet chronically irritated the bladder wall, eventually resulting in tumor development. Since this study, scientific investigation in rats, monkeys, and humans have not found any relationship between saccharine consumption and bladder cancer. In 2000, saccharin was removed from the US National Toxicology Program’s list of potential carcinogens.1 There have been health concerns over other artificial sweeteners, most notably aspartame (sold under the trade names of NutraSweet and Equal).

Most of the energy required by the human body is provided by carbohydrates and lipids. As discussed in the Carbohydrates chapter, glucose is stored in the body as glycogen. While glycogen provides a ready source of energy, lipids primarily function as an energy reserve. As you may recall, glycogen is quite bulky with heavy water content, thus the body cannot store too much for long. Alternatively, fats are packed together tightly without water and store far greater amounts of energy in a reduced space. A fat gram is densely concentrated with energy—it contains more than double the amount of energy than a gram of carbohydrate. Energy is needed to power the muscles for all the physical work and play an average person or child engages in. For instance, the stored energy in muscles propels an athlete down the track, spurs a dancer’s legs to showcase the latest fancy steps, and keeps all the moving parts of the body functioning smoothly. Unlike other body cells that can store fat in limited supplies, fat cells are specialized for fat storage and are able to expand almost indefinitely in size.',\n",

It also gives the body the extra padding required when engaging in physically demanding activities such as ice- or roller skating, horseback riding, or snowboarding. Aiding Digestion and Increasing Bioavailability The dietary fats in the foods we eat break down in our digestive systems and begin the transport of precious micronutrients. By carrying fat-soluble nutrients through the digestive process, intestinal absorption is improved. This improved absorption is also known as increased bioavailability. Fat-soluble nutrients are especially important for good health and exhibit a variety of functions. Vitamins A, D, E, and K—the fat-soluble vitamins—are mainly found in foods containing fat.

For example, 1 gram of fat or oil provides 9 kilocalories of energy, compared with 4 kilocalories found in 1 gram of carbohydrate or protein. Depending on the level of physical activity and on nutritional needs, fat requirements vary greatly from person to person. When energy needs are high, the body welcomes the high-caloric density of fats. For instance, infants and growing children require proper amounts of fat to support normal growth and development. If an infant or child is given a low-fat diet for an extended period, growth and development will not progress normally. Other individuals with high-energy needs are athletes, people who have physically demanding jobs, and those recuperating from illness.

The term saturation refers to whether or not a fatty acid chain is filled (or “saturated”) to capacity with hydrogen atoms. If each available carbon bond holds a hydrogen atom we call this a saturated fatty acid chain. All carbon atoms in such a fatty acid chain are bonded with single bonds. Sometimes the chain has a place where hydrogen atoms are missing. This is referred to as the point of unsaturation. When one or more bonds between carbon atoms are a double bond (C=C), that fatty acid is called an unsaturated fatty acid, as it has one or more points of unsaturation. Any fatty acid that has only one double bond is a monounsaturated fatty acid, an example of which is olive oil (75 percent of its fat is monounsaturated). Monounsaturated fats help regulate blood cholesterol levels, thereby reducing the risk for heart disease and stroke.

Like carbohydrates and protein, lipids are broken into small components for absorption. Since most of our digestive enzymes are water- based, how does the body break down fat and make it available for the various functions it must perform in the human body? From the Mouth to the Stomach The first step in the digestion of triglycerides and phospholipids begins in the mouth as lipids encounter saliva. Next, the physical action of chewing coupled with the action of emulsifiers enables the digestive enzymes to do their tasks. The enzyme lingual lipase, along with a small amount of phospholipid as an emulsifier, initiates the process of digestion. These actions cause the fats to become more accessible to the digestive enzymes. As a result, the fats become tiny droplets and separate from the watery components.

As we uncover what hydrogenation is and why manufacturers use it, you will be better equipped to adhere to healthier dietary choices and promote your heart health. Hydrogenation: The Good Gone Bad? Food manufacturers are aware that fatty acids are susceptible to attack by oxygen molecules because their points of unsaturation render them vulnerable in this regard. When oxygen molecules attack these points of unsaturation the modified fatty acid becomes oxidized. The oxidation of fatty acids makes the oil rancid and gives the food prepared with it an unappetizing taste. Because oils can undergo oxidation when stored in open containers, they must be stored in airtight containers and possibly be refrigerated to minimize damage from oxidation.

Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are used in the fast food and processed food industries because they impart the desired texture and crispness to baked and fried foods.

What You Can Do Remember that saturated fats are found in large amounts in foods of animal origin. They should be limited within the diet. Polyunsaturated fats are generally obtained from non-animal sources. While they are beneficial for lowering bad cholesterol they also lower good cholesterol. They are better for you than saturated fats but are not to be consumed in excess. Monounsaturated fats are of plant origin and are found in most nuts, seeds, seed oils, olive oil, canola oil, and legumes. Monounsaturated fats are excellent because they not only lower bad cholesterol, but also they elevate the good cholesterol.

Create a shopping list and divide your list into columns for “Best,” “Better,” “Good,” “Least Desirable,” and “Infrequent Foods.”As you refine your sense of dietary fat, here are key points to bear in mind: • Shopping for groceries. Don’t be bombarded with gratuitous grams of saturated fats and empty grams of trans fats. Read and decipher food labels carefully so that you know exactly what types of fat a food item contains and how much fat it will contribute to your overall fat intake. For snacks and daily eating, gravitate toward foods that are lowest in or absent of harmful trans fats. Restrict other foods to occasional usage based upon their fat content. For example, if selecting prepared foods, choose the ones without high-fat sauces in favor of adding your own flavorings. If selecting precooked meats, avoid those that are fried, coated, or prepared in high- fat sauces. A popular and healthy precooked meat food choice is the rotisserie chicken that most supermarkets carry.',\n",

Fish is known to be a complete protein source which means that all nine essential amino acids are present in the recommended amounts needed. Native Hawaiians ate their fish raw, cooked, salted or dried. If the fish was to be eaten raw, it was prepared by mashing the flesh with the fingers (lomi) to soften the meat and allow the salt to penetrate the flesh deeper. If the fish was not soft enough to lomi, it was cut into chunks or slices or left whole. Today, the most popular and contemporary prepared way of eating fish is known as poke.

You can stand, walk, run, skate, swim, and more because of your protein-rich muscles. Protein is necessary for proper immune system function, digestion, and hair and nail growth, and is involved in numerous other body functions. In fact, it is estimated that more than one hundred thousand different proteins exist within the human body.

Eleven of these are called nonessential amino acids because the body can synthesize them. However, nine of the amino acids are called essential amino acids because we cannot synthesize them either at all or in sufficient amounts. These must be obtained from the diet. Sometimes during infancy, growth, and in diseased states the body cannot synthesize enough of some of the nonessential amino acids and more of them are required in the diet.

These polypeptide chains then fold into a three-dimensional shape to form a protein (see Figure 6.3 “Formation of Polypeptides”). Additionally, proteins come in many different sizes. The hormone insulin, which regulates blood glucose, is composed of only fifty-one amino acids; whereas collagen, a protein that acts like glue between cells, consists of more than one thousand amino acids. Titin is the largest known protein. It accounts for the elasticity of muscles, and consists of more than twenty-five thousand amino acids!The abundant variations of proteins are due to the unending number of amino acid sequences that can be formed.

RNA is chemically similar to DNA, but has two differences; one is that its backbone uses the sugar ribose and not deoxyribose; and two, it contains the nucleotide base uracil, and not thymidine. The RNA that is transcribed from a given piece of DNA contains the same information as that DNA, but it is now in a form that can be read by the cellular protein manufacturer known as the ribosome. Next, the RNA instructs the cells to gather all the necessary amino acids and add them to the growing protein chain in a very specific order. This process is referred to as translation.

In contrast to carbohydrates, which have identical repeating units, proteins are made up of amino acids that are different from one another. Furthermore, a protein is organized into four different structural levels. Primary: The first level is the one-dimensional sequence of amino acids that are held together by peptide bonds. Carbohydrates and lipids also are one-dimensional sequences of their respective monomers, which may be branched, coiled, fibrous, or globular, but their conformation is much more random and is not organized by their sequence of monomers. Secondary: The second level of protein structure is dependent on the chemical interactions between amino acids, which cause the protein to fold into a specific shape, such as a helix (like a coiled spring) or sheet. 370 | Defining Protein',\n",

As the different side chains of amino acids chemically interact, they either repel or attract each other, resulting in the folded structure. Thus, the specific sequence of amino acids in a protein directs the protein to fold into a specific, organized shape. Quaternary: The fourth level of structure is achieved when protein fragments called peptides combine to make one larger functional protein. The protein hemoglobin is an example of a protein that has quaternary structure. It is composed of four peptides that bond together to form a functional oxygen carrier. A protein’s structure also influences its nutritional quality. Large fibrous protein structures are more difficult to digest than smaller proteins and some, such as keratin, are indigestible. Because digestion of some fibrous proteins is incomplete, not all of the amino acids are absorbed and available for the body to utilize, thereby decreasing their nutritional value.

The foam bubbles are what give the angel food cake its airy texture.) Yogurt is another good example of proteins providing texture. Milk proteins called caseins coagulate, increasing yogurt’s thickness.

Heat, acid, high salt concentrations, alcohol, and mechanical agitation can cause proteins to denature. When a protein denatures, its complicated folded structure unravels, and it becomes just a long strand of amino acids again. Weak chemical forces that hold tertiary and secondary protein structures together are broken when a protein is exposed to unnatural conditions. Because proteins’ function is dependent on their shape, denatured proteins are no longer functional. During cooking the applied heat causes proteins to vibrate.

The stomach releases gastric juices containing hydrochloric acid and the enzyme, pepsin, which initiate the breakdown of the protein. The acidity of the stomach facilitates the unfolding of the proteins that still retain part of their three- dimensional structure after cooking and helps break down the protein aggregates formed during cooking. Pepsin, which is secreted by the cells that line the stomach, dismantles the protein chains into smaller and smaller fragments. Egg proteins are large globular molecules and their chemical breakdown requires time and mixing.

As with other macronutrients, the liver is the checkpoint for amino acid distribution and any further breakdown of amino acids, which is very minimal.

Scar tissue is only about 80 percent as functional as normal uninjured tissue. If a diet is insufficient in protein, the process of wound healing is markedly slowed. While wound healing takes place only after an injury is sustained, a different process called tissue regeneration is ongoing in the body. The main difference between wound healing and tissue regeneration is in the process of regenerating an exact structural and functional copy of the lost tissue. Thus, old, dying tissue is not replaced with scar tissue but with brand new, fully functional tissue.

A healthy diet incorporates all nutrients in moderation. Low protein intake has several health consequences, and a severe lack of protein in the diet eventually causes death. Although severe protein deficiency is a rare occurrence in children and adults in the United States, it is estimated that more than half of the elderly in nursing homes are protein-deficient. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR) for protein for adults is between 10 and 35 percent of kilocalories, which is a fairly wide range. The percent of protein in the diet that is associated with malnutrition and its health consequences is less than 10 percent, but this is often accompanied by deficiencies in calories and other micronutrients. In this section we will discuss the health consequences of protein intake that is either too low to support life’s processes or too high, thereby increasing the risk of chronic disease. In the last section of this chapter, we will discuss in more detail the personal choices you can make to optimize your health by consuming the right amount of high-quality protein. Health Consequences of Protein Deficiency Although severe protein deficiency is rare in the developed world, it is a leading cause of death in children in many poor, underdeveloped countries.

Although the associated mortality is slightly lower now, most children still die after the initiation of treatment. The name Kwashiorkor comes from a language in Ghana and means, “rejected one.”The syndrome was named because it occurred most commonly in children who had recently been weaned from the breast, usually because another child had just been born. Subsequently the child was fed watery porridge made from low-protein grains, which accounts for the low protein intake. Kwashiorkor is characterized by swelling (edema) of the feet and abdomen, poor skin health, growth retardation, low muscle mass, and liver malfunction. Recall that one of protein’s functional roles in the body is fluid balance. Diets extremely low in protein do not provide enough amino acids for the synthesis of albumin. One of the functions of albumin is to hold water in the blood vessels, so having lower concentrations of blood albumin results in water moving out of the blood vessels and into tissues, causing swelling. The primary symptoms of Kwashiorkor include not only swelling, but also diarrhea, fatigue, peeling skin, and irritability.',\n",

However the number of individuals that remain on this type of diet is low and many people who try the diet and stop regain the weight they had lost. Additionally, there is a scientific hypothesis that there may be health consequences of remaining on high-protein diets for the long-term, but clinical trials are ongoing or scheduled to examine this hypothesis further. As the high-protein diet trend arose so did the intensely debated issue of whether there are any health consequences of eating too much protein. Observational studies conducted in the general population suggest diets high in animal protein, specifically those in which the primary protein source is red meat, are linked to a higher risk for kidney stones, kidney disease, liver malfunction, colorectal cancer, and osteoporosis. However, diets that include lots of red meat are also high in saturated fat and cholesterol and sometimes linked to unhealthy lifestyles, so it is difficult to conclude that the high protein content is the culprit. High protein diets appear to only increase the progression of kidney disease and liver malfunction in people who already have kidney or liver malfunction, and not to cause these problems.

The recommendations set by the IOM for the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) and AMDR for protein for different age groups are listed in Table 6.2 “Dietary Reference Intakes for Protein”. A Tolerable Upper Intake Limit for protein has not been set, but it is recommended that you do not exceed the upper end of the AMDR.

Protein Input = Protein Used by the Body + Protein Excreted The appropriate amount of protein in a person’s diet is that which maintains a balance between what is taken in and what is used. The RDAs for protein were determined by assessing nitrogen balance. Nitrogen is one of the four basic elements contained in all amino acids. When proteins are broken down and amino acids are catabolized, nitrogen is released. Remember that when the liver breaks down amino acids, it produces ammonia, which is rapidly converted to nontoxic, nitrogen-containing urea, which is then transported to the kidneys for excretion.',\n",

The IOM used data from multiple studies that determined nitrogen balance in people of different age groups to calculate the RDA for protein. A person is said to be in nitrogen balance when the nitrogen input equals the amount of nitrogen used and excreted. A person is in negative nitrogen balance when the amount of excreted nitrogen is greater than that consumed, meaning that the body is breaking down more protein to meet its demands. This state of imbalance can occur in people who have certain diseases, such as cancer or muscular dystrophy. Someone who has a low-protein diet may also be in negative nitrogen balance as they are taking in less protein than what they actually need. Positive nitrogen balance occurs when a person excretes less nitrogen than what is taken in by the diet, such as during child growth or pregnancy. At these times the body requires more protein to build new tissues, so more of what gets consumed gets used up and less nitrogen is excreted. A person healing from a severe wound may also be in positive nitrogen balance because protein is being used up to repair tissues.',\n",

To avert excessive borrowing of amino acids from muscle tissue to synthesize energy during prolonged exercise, protein needs to be obtained from the diet. Intense exercise, such as strength training, stresses muscle tissue so that afterward, the body adapts by building bigger, stronger, and healthier muscle tissue. The body requires protein post-exercise to accomplish this.

However, this raises another question: if athletes are more efficient at using protein, is it necessary to take in more protein from dietary sources than the average person?There are two scientific schools of thought on this matter. One side believes athletes need more protein and the other thinks the protein requirements of athletes are the same as for nonathletes. There is scientific evidence to support both sides of this debate. The consensus of both sides is that few people exercise at the intensity that makes this debate relevant.',\n",

Is taking protein supplements ever justified, then?Neither protein nor amino acid supplements have been scientifically proven to improve exercise performance or increase strength. In addition, the average American already consumes more protein than is required. Despite these facts, many highly physically active individuals use protein or amino acid supplements. According to the AND, American College of Sports Medicine, and Dietitians of Canada, “the current evidence indicates that protein and amino acid supplements are no more or no less effective than food when energy is adequate for gaining lean body mass.”5 Branched-chain amino acids, such as leucine, are often touted as a way to build muscle tissue and enhance athletic performance. Despite these marketing claims, a review in the June 2005 issue of The Journal of Nutrition shows that most studies that evaluated a variety of exercise types failed to show any performance-enhancing effects of taking branched-chain amino acids.6 5.

This means if you are interested in enhancing exercise performance or building muscle, you do not need to support the $20 billion supplement industry. Although the evidence for protein and amino acid supplements impacting athletic performance is lacking, there is some scientific evidence that supports consuming high-quality dairy proteins, such as casein and whey, and soy proteins positively influences muscle recovery in response to hard training. If you choose to buy a bucket of whey protein, use it to make a protein shake after an intense workout and do not add more than what is required to obtain 20 to 25 grams of protein. As always, choosing high-quality protein foods will help you build muscle and not empty your wallet as much as buying supplements.

For thousands of years, alcohol has been consumed in a medicinal, celebratory, and ritualistic manner. It is drunk in just about every country and often in excessive amounts. Alcohol can be made from a variety of different starch foods through the processes called fermentation. Fermentation of a starchy food such as barley or wheat can produce ethanol and CO2 which makes up what is commonly known as beer. The Native Hawaiians distilled a mash of fermented ti roots in iron try-pots pre-colonization in the 1700s. This form of alcohol was called “Okolehao”. This alcoholic beverage more commonly known today as “moonshine”, is still made locally in the islands today.1 Alcohol is a psychoactive drug. A psychoactive drug is any substance that crosses the blood-brain barrier primarily affecting the functioning of the brain, be it altering mood, thinking, memory, motor control, or behavior.

In the United States, the Dietary Guidelines define moderate alcohol intake as no more than one drink per day for women and no more than two drinks per day for men.4 Although drunkenness has pervaded many cultures, drinking in moderation has long been a mantra of multiple cultures with access to alcohol.

However, alcohol displays its two-faced character again in its effects on body weight, making many scientific studies contradictory. Multiple studies show high intakes of hard liquor are linked to weight gain, although this may be the result of the regular consumption of hard liquor with sugary soft drinks, juices, and other mixers. On the other hand drinking beer and, even more so, red wine, is not consistently linked to weight gain and in some studies actually decreases weight gain. The contradictory results of scientific studies that have examined the association of alcohol intake with body weight are partly due to the fact that alcohol contributes calories to the diet. When alcohol is drunk in excess, it reduces the secretion of pancreatic juice and damages the lining of the gastrointestinal system, impairing nutrient digestion and absorption. The impaired digestion and absorption of nutrients in alcoholics contributes to their characteristic “skinniness” and multiple associated micronutrient deficiencies. The most common macronutrient deficiency among alcoholics is water, as it is excreted in excess. Commonly associated micronutrient deficiencies include thiamine, pyridoxine, folate, vitamin A, magnesium, calcium, and zinc. Furthermore, alcoholics typically replace calories from alcohol with those of nutritious foods, sometimes getting 50 percent or more of their daily caloric intake from alcoholic beverages.',\n",

Epinephrine also stimulates the breakdown of triglycerides and glycerol into free fatty acids in adipose tissue and are released into the bloodstream and travel to the liver.

A review of twenty-nine studies concluded that moderate alcohol intake reduces the risk of coronary heart disease by about 30 percent in comparison to those who do not consume alcohol.1 Several other studies demonstrate that moderate alcohol consumption reduces the incidences of stroke and heart attack, and also death caused by cardiovascular and heart disease. The drop in risk for these adverse events ranges between percent. Moreover, there is some scientific evidence that moderate alcohol intake reduces the risk for metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, and gallstones. In addition to providing some health benefits, moderate alcohol intake also serves as a digestive aid, a source of comfort and relaxation, and inducing social interactions, thereby benefiting all aspects of the health triangle.

Having a nutrition plan for race day is equally important for achieving peak performance and there are all sorts of products available with claims about digestibility, energy-sustenance, and promises of optimal performance results.

The chemical breakdown of those chemicals provides the energy needed to carry out thousands of body functions that allow the body to perform daily functions and tasks such as breathing, walking up a flight of steps, and studying for a test. Energy is classified as either potential or kinetic. Potential energy is stored energy, or energy waiting to happen. Kinetic energy is energy in motion.

This potential energy is converted into kinetic energy in the body that drives many body functions ranging from muscle and nerve function to driving the synthesis of body protein for growth. After potential energy is released to provide kinetic energy, it ultimately becomes thermal energy or heat. You can notice this when you exercise and your body heats up. The Calorie Is a Unit of Energy The amount of energy in nutrients or the amount of energy expended by the body can be quantified with a variety of units used to measure energy.

Since calories and Joules are both measures of energy, one can be converted to the other – 1 kcal = 4.18 kJ. Estimating Caloric Content The energy contained in energy-yielding nutrients differs because the energy-yielding nutrients are composed of different types of chemical bonds. The carbohydrate or protein in a food yields approximately 4 kilocalories per gram, whereas the triglycerides that compose the fat in a food yield 9 kilocalories per gram. A kilocalorie of energy performs one thousand times more work than a calorie. On the Nutrition Facts panel found on packaged food, the calories listed for a particular food are actually kilocalories.

Proper nutrition provides the necessary nutrients to make the energy that supports life’s processes. Your body builds new macromolecules from the nutrients in food. Nutrient and Energy Flow Energy is stored in a nutrient’s chemical bonds. Energy comes from sunlight, which plants capture and, via photosynthesis, use it to transform carbon dioxide in the air into the molecule glucose. When the glucose bonds are broken, energy is released. Bacteria, plants, and animals (including humans) harvest the energy in glucose via a biological process called cellular respiration.

Food Quality One measurement of food quality is the amount of nutrients it contains relative to the amount of energy it provides. High-quality foods are nutrient dense, meaning they contain lots of nutrients relative to the amount of calories they provide. Nutrient-dense foods are the opposite of “empty-calorie” foods such as carbonated sugary soft drinks, which provide many calories and very little, if any, other nutrients.

Protons and neutrons are contained in the dense nucleus of the atom; the nucleus thus has a positive charge. Because opposites attract, electrons are attracted to this nucleus and move around it in the electron cloud. Electrons contain energy, and this energy is stored within the charge and movement of electrons and the bonds atoms make with one another. However, this energy is not always stable, depending on the number of electrons within an atom. Atoms are more stable when their electrons orbit in pairs. An atom with an odd number of electrons must have an unpaired electron. In most cases, these unpaired electrons are used to create chemical bonds.

Metabolism is either categorized as catabolism, referring to all metabolic processes involved in molecule breakdown, or anabolism, which includes all metabolic processes involved in building bigger molecules. Generally, catabolic processes release energy and anabolic processes consume energy. The overall goals of metabolism are energy transfer and matter transport. Energy is transformed from food macronutrients into cellular energy, which is used to perform cellular work. Metabolism transforms the matter of macronutrients into substances a cell can use to grow and reproduce and also into waste products. For example, enzymes are proteins and their job is to catalyze chemical reactions. Catalyze means to speed-up a chemical reaction and reduce the energy required to complete the chemical reaction, without the catalyst being used up in the reaction. Without enzymes, chemical reactions would not happen at a fast enough rate and would use up too much energy for life to exist. A metabolic pathway is a series of enzyme catalyzed reactions that transform the starting material (known as a substrate) into intermediates, that are the substrates for subsequent enzymatic reactions in the pathway, until, finally, an end product is synthesized by the last enzymatic reaction in the pathway.',\n",

Catabolism of food molecules begins when food enters the mouth, as the enzyme salivary amylase initiates the breakdown of the starch in foods. The entire process of digestion converts the large polymers in food to monomers that can be absorbed. Starches are broken down to monosaccharides, lipids are broken down to fatty acids, and proteins are broken down to amino acids. These monomers are absorbed into the bloodstream either directly, as is the case with monosaccharides and amino acids, or repackaged in intestinal cells for transport by an indirect route through lymphatic vessels, as is the case with most fatty acids and other fat-soluble molecules. Once absorbed, water-soluble nutrients first travel to the liver which controls their passage into the blood that transports the nutrients to cells throughout the body. The fat-soluble nutrients gradually pass from the lymphatic vessels into blood flowing to body cells. Cells requiring energy or building blocks take up the nutrients from the blood and process them in either catabolic or anabolic pathways. The organ systems of the body require fuel and building blocks to perform the many functions of the body, such as digesting, absorbing, breathing, pumping blood, transporting nutrients in and wastes out, maintaining body temperature, and making new cells.

Electron Transport Chain and ATP synthesis Figure 8.4 ATP Production Pathway The breakdown of glucose begins with glycolysis, which is a ten- step metabolic pathway yielding two ATP per glucose molecule; glycolysis takes place in the cytosol and does not require oxygen. In addition to ATP, the end-products of glycolysis include two three- carbon molecules, called pyruvate. Pyruvate can either be shuttled to the citric acid cycle to make more ATP or follow an anabolic pathway. If a cell is in negative-energy balance, pyruvate is transported to the mitochondria where it first gets one of its carbons chopped off, yielding acetyl-CoA. The breakdown of fatty acids begins with the catabolic pathway, known as β-oxidation, which takes place in the mitochondria. In this catabolic pathway, four enzymatic steps sequentially remove two-carbon molecules from long chains of fatty acids, yielding acetyl-CoA molecules. In the case of amino acids, once the nitrogen is removed from the amino acid the remaining carbon skeleton can be enzymatically converted into acetyl-CoA or some other intermediate of the citric acid cycle. Acetyl-CoA, a two-carbon molecule common to glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism enters the second stage of energy metabolism, the citric acid cycle.',\n",

NADH and FADH2 carry the electrons to the inner membrane in the mitochondria where the third stage of energy release takes place, in what is called the electron transport chain. In this metabolic pathway a sequential transfer of electrons between multiple proteins occurs and ATP is synthesized. The entire process of nutrient catabolism is chemically similar to burning, as carbon and hydrogen atoms are combusted (oxidized) producing carbon dioxide, water, and heat. However, the stepwise chemical reactions in nutrient catabolism pathways slow the oxidation of carbon atoms so that much of the energy is captured and not all transformed into heat and light. Complete nutrient catabolism is between 30 and 40 percent efficient, and some of the energy is therefore released as heat. Heat is a vital product of nutrient catabolism and is involved in maintaining body temperature. If cells were too efficient at trapping nutrient energy into ATP, humans would not last to the next meal, as they would die of hypothermia (excessively low body temperature).

A nutrient’s metabolic path is dependent upon energy balance. When you are in a positive energy balance the excess nutrient energy will be stored or used to grow (e.g., during childhood, pregnancy, and wound healing). When you are in negative energy balance you aren’t taking in enough energy to meet your needs, so your body will need to use its stores to provide energy. Energy balance is achieved when intake of energy is equal to energy expended. Weight can be thought of as a whole body estimate of energy balance; body weight is maintained when the body is in energy balance, lost when it is in negative energy balance, and gained when it is in positive energy balance. In general, weight is a good predictor of energy balance, but many other factors play a role in energy intake and energy expenditure. Some of these factors are under your control and others are not.

Estimating Energy Requirement To maintain body weight you have to balance the calories obtained from food and beverages with the calories expended every day. Here, we will discuss how to calculate your energy needs in kilocalories per day so that you can determine whether your caloric intake falls short, meets, or exceeds your energy needs. The Institute of Medicine has devised a formula for calculating your Estimated Energy Requirement (EER). It takes into account your age, sex, weight, height, and physical activity level (PA). The EER is a standardized mathematical prediction of a person’s daily energy needs in kilocalories per day required to maintain weight. It is calculated for those over 18 years of age via the following formulas: Adult male: EER = 662 − [9.53 X age (y)] + PA X [15.91 X wt (kg) + 5.39.6 X ht (m)] Adult female: EER = 354 − [6.91 x age (y)] + PA x [9.36 x wt (kg) + 726 x ht (m)] Note: to convert pounds to kilograms, divide weight in pounds by 2.2.

BMR is dependent on body size, body composition, sex, age, nutritional status, and genetics. People with a larger frame size have a higher BMR simply because they have more mass. Muscle tissue burns more calories than fat tissue even while at rest and thus the more muscle mass a person has, the higher their BMR. Since females typically have less muscle mass and a smaller frame size than men, their BMRs are generally lower than men’s. As we get older muscle mass declines and thus so does BMR. Nutritional status also affects basal metabolism. Caloric restriction, as occurs while dieting, for example, causes a decline in BMR.

The hypothalamus in the brain is the main control point of appetite. It receives hormonal and neural signals, which determine if you feel hungry or full.

Hunger pangs are real and so is a “growling” stomach. When the stomach is empty it contracts, producing the characteristic pang and “growl.”The stomach’s mechanical movements relay neural signals to the hypothalamus, which relays other neural signals to parts of the brain. This results in the conscious feeling of the need to eat. Alternatively, after you eat a meal the stomach stretches and sends a neural signal to the brain stimulating the sensation of satiety and relaying the message to stop eating. The stomach also sends out certain hormones when it is full and others when it is empty. These hormones communicate to the hypothalamus and other areas of the brain either to stop eating or to find some food.',\n",

Alas, this is not the case. In several clinical trials it was found that people who are overweight or obese are actually resistant to the hormone, meaning their brain does not respond as well to it.1 Therefore, when you administer leptin to an overweight or obese person there is no sustained effect on food intake. Nutrients themselves also play a role in influencing food intake. The hypothalamus senses nutrient levels in the blood. When they are low the hunger center is stimulated, and when they are high the satiety center is stimulated. Furthermore, cravings for salty and sweet foods have an underlying physiological basis. Both undernutrition and overnutrition affect hormone levels and the neural circuitry controlling appetite, which makes losing or gaining weight a substantial physiological hurdle.

Tools for Change Support the consumer movement of pushing the fast food industry and your favorite local restaurants into serving more nutrient- dense foods. You can begin this task by starting simple, such as requesting extra tomatoes and lettuce on your burger and more nutrient-dense choices in the salad bar. Also, choose their low- calorie menu options and help support the emerging market of healthier choices in the fast food industry. In today’s fast-paced society, it is difficult for most people to avoid fast food all the time. When you do need a quick bite on the run, choose the fast food restaurants that serve healthier foods.

Some believe that this theory provides an explanation as to why after dieting, most people return to their original weight not long after stopping the diet.

A major problem with these theories is that they overgeneralize and do not take into account that not all individuals respond in the same way to changes in food intake or energy expenditure. This brings up the importance of the interactions of genes and the environment. Not all individuals who take a weight-loss drug lose weight and not all people who smoke are thin. An explanation for these discrepancies is that each individual’s genes respond differently to a specific environment. Alternatively, environmental factors can influence a person’s gene profile, which is exemplified by the effects of the prenatal environment on body weight and fatness and disease incidence later in life.1 One example is a study of the offspring of women who were overweight during pregnancy had a greater propensity for being overweight and for developing Type 2 diabetes. Thus, undernutrition and overnutrition during pregnancy influence body weight and disease risk for offspring later in life. They do so by adapting energy metabolism to the early nutrient and hormonal environment in the womb. 1. Matthews CE, Chen KY, et al. (',\n",

Escalators, moving walkways, and elevators (not to mention cars!)are common modes of transportation that reduce average daily energy expenditure. Office work, high-stress jobs, and occupations requiring extended working hours are all societal pressures that reduce the time allotted for exercise of large populations of Americans. Even the remote controls that many have for various electronic devices in their homes contribute to the US society being less active. More obesogenic factors were discussed in the weight management section of this chapter. Socioeconomic status has been found to be inversely proportional to weight gain. One reason for this relationship is that inhabitants of low-income neighborhoods have reduced access to safe streets and parks for walking. Another is that fitness clubs are expensive and few are found in lower-income neighborhoods. The recent and long-lasting economic crisis in this country is predicted to have profound effects on the average body weight of Americans.',\n",

China, the most populous country in the world, now has more than 215 million people, approximately one-fifth of their population, that are considered overweight or obese.4 The increase in China’s waistline is partly attributed to changes in the traditional diet, more sedentary lives, and a massive increase in motor vehicle use. Moreover, China’s recent famines in the 1950s, which affected the poor and lower classes to a greater extent than the upper class, have sanctioned lax social attitudes toward body fat and reinspired the age-old Chinese belief that excess body fat represents health and prosperity. One of the worst statistics regarding overweight and obesity in China is that more than ten million adolescents between ages seventeen and eighteen were overweight in 2000, which is twenty- eight times the number that were overweight in 1985.5 The associated diseases of overweight and obesity happen over many years, and signs and symptoms commonly take decades to manifest. With China’s younger population and other developed countries experiencing a dramatic weight increase, the associated chronic diseases will come about much earlier in life than in previous generations.

Moreover, most members eat breakfast every day, watch fewer than ten hours of television per week, and weigh themselves at least once per week. About half of them lost weight on their own, and the other half used some type of weight-loss program. In most scientific studies successful weight loss is accomplished only by changing the diet and by increasing physical activity. Doing one without the other limits the amount of weight lost and the length of time that weight loss is sustained. On an individual level it is quite possible to achieve successful weight loss, as over ten thousand Americans can attest. Moreover, losing as little as 10 percent of your body weight can significantly improve health and reduce disease risk.4 You do not have to be overweight or obese to reap benefits from eating a healthier diet and increasing physical activity as both provide numerous benefits beyond weight loss and maintenance.

The Dietary Guidelines are complemented by the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in an effort to provide evidence- based guidelines for appropriate physical activity levels. The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines provide guidance to Americans aged six and older about how to improve health and reduce chronic disease risk through physical activity. Increased physical activity has been found in scientific studies to lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, colon, breast, and lung cancer, falls and fractures, depression, and early death. Increased physical activity not only reduces disease risk, but also improves overall health by increasing cardiovascular and muscular fitness, increasing bone density and strength, improving cognitive function, and assisting in weight loss and weight maintenance.6 The key guidelines for adults are the following (those for pregnant women, children, and older people will be given in Chapter 13): 6. 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.

The “Small-Change” Approach Currently, most people are not obese in this country. The gradual rise in overweight is happening because, on average, people consume slightly more calories daily than they expend, resulting in a gradual weight gain of one to two pounds a year. In 2003 the idea was first published that promoting small lifestyle changes to reduce weight gain occurring over time in all age groups may better reduce obesity rates in the American population.10 Scientific studies have demonstrated that asking people to increase the number of steps they take each day while providing them with pedometers that count the steps they take each day successfully prevented weight gain. A “small-changes” study published in the October 2007 issue of Pediatrics evaluated whether families that made two small lifestyle changes, which were to walk an additional two thousand steps per day and to eliminate 100 kilocalories per day from their typical diet by replacing dietary sugar with a noncaloric sweetener, would prevent weight gain in 10.

In 2009, a report of the Joint Task Force of the American Society for Nutrition, Institute of Food Technologists, and International Food Information Council proposed that the “small-changes” approach when supported at the community, industry, and governmental levels will be more effective than current strategies in gradually reducing the obesity rate in America.13 11.

If a diet is lacking a certain type of nutrient, a vitamin deficiency may occur. The traditional diet in Pohnpei (an island in the Federal States of Micronesia) consisted of a diet rich in local tropical produce such as bananas, papaya, mango, pineapple, coconut as well as seafood. However, due to a shift in dietary patterns from fresh foods to processed and refined foods the island is suffering from a magnitude of health concerns. A study conducted by the Department of Health of the Federated States of Micronesia on children aged two to four years old in Pohnpei showed that the prevalence for vitamin A deficiency among children aged 2-5 was 53 percent1. 1.

Vitamins are organic compounds that are traditionally assigned to two groups fat-soluble (hydrophobic) or water-soluble (hydrophilic). This classification determines where they act in the body. Water-soluble vitamins act in the cytosol of cells or in extracellular fluids such as blood; fat-soluble vitamins are largely responsible for protecting cell membranes from free radical damage. The body can synthesize some vitamins, but others must be obtained from the diet. Figure 9.1 The Vitamins https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14984164. Accessed October 15, 2017.

       "  'sentence_chunk': 'Image by Allison Calabrese / CC BY 4.0 One major difference between fat-soluble vitamins and water- soluble vitamins is the way they are absorbed in the body. Vitamins are absorbed primarily in the small intestine and their bioavailability is dependent on the food composition of the diet. Fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed along with dietary fat. Therefore, if a meal is very low in fat, the absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins will be impaired. Once fat-soluble vitamins have been absorbed in the small intestine, they are packaged and incorporated into chylomicrons along with other fatty acids and transported in the lymphatic system to the liver. Water-soluble vitamins on the other hand are absorbed in the small intestine but are transported to the liver through blood vessels.

Retinol is the form of vitamin A found in animal-derived foods, and is converted in the body to the biologically active forms of vitamin A: retinal and retinoic acid (thus retinol is sometimes referred to as “preformed vitamin A”). About 10 percent of plant- derived carotenoids, including beta-carotene, can be converted in the body to retinoids and are another source of functional vitamin A. Carotenoids are pigments synthesized by plants that give them their yellow, orange, and red color. Over six hundred carotenoids have been identified and, with just a few exceptions, all are found in the plant kingdom. There are two classes of carotenoids—the xanthophylls, which contain oxygen, and the carotenes, which do not. In plants, carotenoids absorb light for use in photosynthesis and act as antioxidants. Beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta- cryptoxanthin are converted to some extent to retinol in the body. The other carotenoids, such as lycopene, are not. Many biological actions of carotenoids are attributed to their antioxidant activity, but they likely act by other mechanisms, too.

In the liver, carotenoids are repackaged into lipoproteins, which transport them to cells. The retinoids are aptly named as their most notable function is in the retina of the eye where they aid in vision, particularly in seeing under low-light conditions. This is why night blindness is the most definitive sign of vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A has several important functions in the body, including maintaining vision and a healthy immune system. Many of vitamin A’s functions in the body are similar to the functions of hormones (for example, vitamin A can interact with DNA, causing a change in protein function). Vitamin A assists in maintaining healthy skin and the linings and coverings of tissues; it also regulates growth and development. As an antioxidant, vitamin A protects cellular membranes, helps in maintaining glutathione levels, and influences the amount and activity of enzymes that detoxify free radicals. Vision Retinol that is circulating in the blood is taken up by cells in the eye retina, where it is converted to retinal and is used to help the pigment rhodopsin, which is involved in the eye’s ability to see under low light conditions. A deficiency in vitamin A thus results in less rhodopsin and a decrease in the detection of low-level light, a condition referred to as night-blindness.',\n",

In Asia in the late 1980s, targeted populations of children were administered vitamin A supplements, and the death rates from measles and diarrhea declined by up to 50 percent. Vitamin A supplementation in these deficient populations did not reduce the number of children who contracted these diseases, but it did decrease the severity of the diseases so that they were no longer fatal. Soon after the results of these studies were communicated to the rest of the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) commenced worldwide campaigns against vitamin A deficiency. UNICEF estimates that the distribution of over half a billion vitamin A capsules prevents 350,000 childhood deaths annually.1 In the twenty-first century, science has demonstrated that vitamin A greatly affects the immune system. What we are still lacking are clinical trials investigating the proper doses of vitamin A required to help ward off infectious disease and how large of an effect vitamin A supplementation has on populations that are not deficient in this vitamin. This brings up one of our common themes in this text—micronutrient deficiencies may contribute to the development, progression, and severity of a disease, but this does not mean that an increased intake of these micronutrients will solely prevent or cure disease. The effect, as usual, is cumulative and depends on the diet as a whole, among other things. 1. Sommer A. (2008).',\n",

Furthermore, both males and females require vitamin A in the diet to effectively reproduce. Cancer Vitamin A’s role in regulating cell growth and death, especially in tissues that line and cover organs, suggests it may be effective in treating certain cancers of the lung, neck, and liver. It has been shown in some observational studies that vitamin A-deficient populations have a higher risk for some cancers. However, vitamin A supplements have actually been found to increase the risk of lung cancer in people who are at high risk for the disease (i.e., smokers, ex-smokers, workers exposed to asbestos).

Some carotenoids are converted to retinol in the body by intestinal cells and liver cells.

The RDA for vitamin A includes all sources of vitamin A. The RDA for vitamin A is given in mcg of Retinol Activity Equivalent (RAE) to take into account the many different forms it is available in. The human body converts all dietary sources of vitamin A into retinol. Therefore, 1 mcg of retinol is equivalent to 12 mcg of beta- carotene, and 24 mcg of alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin. For example, 12 micrograms of fruit- or vegetable-based beta-carotene will yield 1 microgram of retinol. Currently vitamin A listed in food and on supplement labels use international units (IUs). The following conversions are listed below3: • 1 IU retinol = 0.3 mcg RAE • 1 IU beta-carotene from dietary supplements = 0.15 mcg RAE • 1 IU beta-carotene from food = 0.05 mcg RAE • 1 IU alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin = 0.025 mcg RAE 3.

In the absence of an adequate intake of vitamin D, less than 15 percent of calcium is absorbed from foods or supplements. The effects of calcitriol on calcium homeostasis are critical for bone health. A deficiency of vitamin D in children causes the bone disease nutritional rickets. Rickets is very common among children in developing countries and is characterized by soft, weak, deformed bones that are exceptionally susceptible to fracture. In adults, vitamin D deficiency causes a similar disease called osteomalacia, which is characterized by low BMD. Osteomalacia has the same symptoms and consequences as osteoporosis and often coexists with osteoporosis. Vitamin D deficiency is common, especially in the elderly population, dark- skinned populations, and in the many people who live in the northern latitudes where sunlight exposure is much decreased during the long winter season.

Dietary Reference Intake for Vitamin D The Institute of Medicine RDAs for vitamin D for different age groups is listed in Table 10.4 “Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin D”. For adults, the RDA is 600 international units (IUs), which is equivalent to 15 micrograms of vitamin D. The National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends slightly higher levels and that adults under age fifty get between 400 and 800 international units of vitamin D every day, and adults fifty and older get between 800 and 1,000 international units of vitamin D every day. According to the IOM, the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for vitamin D is 4,000 international units per day. Toxicity from excess vitamin D is rare, but certain diseases such as hyperparathyroidism, lymphoma, and tuberculosis make people more sensitive to the increases in calcium caused by high intakes of vitamin D.

Vitamins and minerals that make up part of enzymes are referred to as coenzymes and cofactors, respectively. Coenzymes and cofactors are required by enzymes to catalyze a specific reaction. They assist in converting a substrate to an end-product. Coenzymes and cofactors are essential in catabolic pathways and play a role in many anabolic pathways too. In addition to being essential for metabolism, many vitamins and minerals are required for blood renewal and function. At insufficient levels in the diet these vitamins and minerals impair the health of blood and consequently the delivery of nutrients in and wastes out, amongst its many other functions.

Vitamin C is not stored in any significant amount in the body, but once it has reduced a free radical, it is very effectively regenerated and therefore it can exist in the body as a functioning antioxidant for many weeks. The classic condition associated with vitamin C deficiency is scurvy.

As with the studies on cardiovascular disease, the reduced risk of cancer is the result of eating foods rich in vitamin C, such as fruits and vegetables, not from taking vitamin C supplements.

Moreover, taking megadoses (up to 4 grams per day) at the onset of a cold provides no benefits.3 Gout is a disease caused by elevated circulating levels of uric acid and is characterized by recurrent attacks of tender, hot, and painful joints. There is some evidence that a higher intake of vitamin C reduces the risk of gout. Vitamin C Toxicity High doses of vitamin C have been reported to cause numerous problems, but the only consistently shown side effects are gastrointestinal upset and diarrhea. To prevent these discomforts the IOM has set a UL for adults at 2,000 milligrams per day (greater than twenty times the RDA). At very high doses in combination with iron, vitamin C has sometimes been found to increase oxidative stress, reaffirming that getting your antioxidants from foods is better than getting them from supplements, as that helps regulate your intake levels.

It acts as a cofactor for enzymes that break down glucose for energy production (Figure 9.7 “Enzyme Active Site for Cofactors” ). Thiamin plays a key role in nerve cells as the glucose that is catabolized by thiamin is needed for an energy source. Additionally, thiamin plays a role in the synthesis of neurotransmitters and is therefore required for RNA, DNA, and ATP synthesis. The brain and heart are most affected by a deficiency in thiamin. Thiamin deficiency, also known as beriberi, can cause symptoms of fatigue, confusion, movement impairment, pain in the lower extremities, swelling, and heart failure. It is prevalent in societies whose main dietary staple is white rice. During the processing of white rice, the bran is removed, along with what were called in the early nineteenth century, “accessory factors,” that are vital for metabolism. Dutch physician Dr. Christiaan Eijkman cured chickens of beriberi by feeding them unpolished rice bran in 1897. By 1912, Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins determined from his experiments with animals that the “accessory factors,” eventually renamed vitamins, are needed in the diet to support growth, since animals fed a diet of pure carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and minerals failed to grow.4Eijkman and Hopkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology (or Medicine) in 1929 for their discoveries in the emerging science of nutrition.',\n",

As mentioned in Figure 9.19 “ Vitamin B6 Functional Coenzyme Role”, high levels of homocysteine in the blood increases the risk for heart disease. Low levels of vitamin B12, folate or vitamin B6 will increase homocysteine levels therefore increasing the risk of heart disease. Figure 9.20 The Relationship Between Folate and Vitamin B12 When there is a deficiency in vitamin B12 , inactive folate (from food) is unable to be converted to active folate and used in the body for the synthesis of DNA. Folic Acid however (that comes from supplements or fortified foods) is available to be used as active folate in the body without vitamin B12 . Therefore, if there is a deficiency in vitamin B12 macrocytic anemia may occur. With the fortification of foods incorporated into people’s diets, the risk of an individual developing macrocytic anemia is decreased. 584 | Water-Soluble Vitamins',\n",

Although some marketers claim taking a vitamin that contains one- thousand times the daily value of certain B vitamins boosts energy and performance, this is a myth that is not backed by science. The “feeling” of more energy from energy-boosting supplements stems from the high amount of added sugars, caffeine, and other herbal stimulants that accompany the high doses of B vitamins.

Buyers of B-vitamin supplements beware; B vitamins are not stored in the body and all excess will be flushed down the toilet along with the extra money spent. B vitamins are naturally present in numerous foods, and many other foods are enriched with them. In the United States, B-vitamin deficiencies are rare; however in the nineteenth century some vitamin-B deficiencies plagued many people in North America. Niacin deficiency, also known as pellagra, was prominent in poorer Americans whose main dietary staple was refined cornmeal. Its symptoms were severe and included diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and even death. Some of the health consequences of pellagra are the result of niacin being in insufficient supply to support the body’s metabolic functions.',\n",

Based on the antioxidant-supplement industry’s success, the general public appears to believe these health claims. However, these claims are not backed by scientific evidence; rather, there is some evidence suggesting supplements can actually cause harm. While scientists have found evidence supporting the consumption of antioxidant-rich foods as a method of reducing the risk of chronic disease, there is no “miracle cure”; no pill or supplement alone can provide the same benefits as a healthy diet. Remember, it is the combination of antioxidants and other nutrients in healthy foods that is beneficial. In this section, we will review how particular antioxidants function in the body, learn how they work together to protect the body against free radicals, and explore the best nutrient-rich dietary sources of antioxidants.

For example, the immune system uses the cell-damaging properties of free radicals to kill pathogens. First, immune cells engulf an invader (such as a bacterium), then they expose it to free radicals such as hydrogen peroxide, which destroys its membrane. The invader is thus neutralized. Scientific studies also suggest hydrogen peroxide acts as a signaling molecule that calls immune cells to injury sites, meaning free radicals may aid with tissue repair when you get cut. Free radicals are necessary for many other bodily functions as well. The thyroid gland synthesizes its own hydrogen peroxide, which is required for the production of thyroid hormone. Reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, which are free radicals containing nitrogen, have been found to interact with proteins in cells to produce signaling molecules. The free radical nitric oxide has been found to help dilate blood vessels and act as a chemical messenger in the brain. By acting as signaling molecules, free radicals are involved in the control of their own synthesis, stress responses, regulation of cell growth and death, and metabolism.',\n",

Oxidative Stress Oxidative stress refers to an imbalance in any cell, tissue, or organ between the amount of free radicals and the capabilities of the detoxifying and repair systems. Sustained oxidative damage results only under conditions of oxidative stress—when the detoxifying and repair systems are insufficient. Free radical-induced damage, when left unrepaired, destroys lipids, proteins, RNA, and DNA, and can contribute to disease. Oxidative stress has been implicated as a contributing factor to cancer, atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries), arthritis, diabetes, kidney disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, emphysema, and cataracts. Aging is a process that is genetically determined but modulated by factors in the environment. In the process of aging, tissue function declines.

Many phytochemicals act as antioxidants, but they have several other functions, such as mimicking hormones, altering absorption of cholesterol, inhibiting inflammatory responses, and blocking the actions of certain enzymes. Phytochemicals are present in small amounts in the food supply, and although thousands have been and are currently being scientifically studied, their health benefits remain largely unknown. Also largely unknown is their potential for toxicity, which could be substantial if taken in large amounts in the form of supplements. Moreover, phytochemicals often act in conjunction with each other and with micronutrients. Thus, supplementing with only a few may impair the functions of other phytochemicals or micronutrients.

There are 20 essential minerals that must be consumed in our diets to remain healthy. The amount of each mineral found in our bodies vary greatly and therefore, so does consumption of those minerals. When there is a deficiency in an essential mineral, health problems may arise. Major minerals are classified as minerals that are required in the diet each day in amounts larger than 100 milligrams. These include sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and sulfur. These major minerals can be found in various foods.

Although only 1 percent of the calcium in the human body is found in the blood and soft tissues, it is here that it performs the most critical functions. Blood calcium levels are rigorously controlled so that if blood levels drop the body will rapidly respond by stimulating bone resorption, thereby releasing stored calcium into the blood. Thus, bone tissue sacrifices its stored calcium to maintain blood calcium levels. This is why bone health is dependent on the intake of dietary calcium and also why blood levels of calcium do not always correspond to dietary intake. Calcium plays a role in a number of different functions in the body like bone and tooth formation. The most well-known calcium function is to build and strengthen bones and teeth. Recall that when bone tissue first forms during the modeling or remodeling process, it is unhardened, protein-rich osteoid tissue. In the osteoblast-directed process of bone mineralization, calcium phosphates (salts) are deposited on the protein matrix. The calcium salts typically make up about 65 percent of bone tissue.',\n",

Calcium is also essential in blood clotting by activating clotting factors to fix damaged tissue. In addition to calcium’s four primary functions calcium has several other minor functions that are also critical for maintaining normal physiology. For example, without calcium, the hormone insulin could not be released from cells in the pancreas and glycogen could not be broken down in muscle cells and used to provide energy for muscle contraction. Maintaining Calcium Levels Because calcium performs such vital functions in the body, blood calcium level is closely regulated by the hormones parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitriol, and calcitonin. When blood calcium levels are low, PTH is secreted to increase blood calcium levels via three different mechanisms. First, PTH stimulates the release of calcium stored in the bone. Second, PTH acts on kidney cells to increase calcium reabsorption and decrease its excretion in the urine. Third, PTH stimulates enzymes in the kidney that activate vitamin D to calcitriol. Calcitriol is the active hormone that acts on the intestinal cells and increases dietary calcium absorption.',\n",

Although higher calcium consumption protects against colon cancer, some studies have looked at the relationship between calcium and prostate cancer and found higher intakes may increase the risk for prostate cancer; however the data is inconsistent and more studies are needed to confirm any negative association. • Blood pressure.

Another health benefit of a high-calcium diet is that it blocks kidney stone formation. Calcium inhibits the absorption of oxalate, a chemical in plants such as parsley and spinach, which is associated with an increased risk for developing kidney stones.

This is partly attributed to the fact that dietary sources of calcium supply additional nutrients with health-promoting activities. It is reported that chelated forms of calcium supplements are easier to absorb as the chelation process protects the calcium from oxalates and phytates that may bind with the calcium in the intestines. However, these are more expensive supplements and only increase calcium absorption up to 10 percent. In people with low dietary intakes of calcium, calcium supplements have a negligible benefit on bone health in the absence of a vitamin D supplement. However, when calcium supplements are taken along with vitamin D, there are many benefits to bone health: peak bone mass is increased in early adulthood, BMD is maintained throughout adulthood, the risk of developing osteoporosis is reduced, and the incidence of fractures is decreased in those who already had osteoporosis. Calcium and vitamin D pills do not have to be taken at the same time for effectiveness. But remember that vitamin D has to be activated and in the bloodstream to promote calcium absorption. Thus, it is important to maintain an adequate intake of vitamin D.

Dietary Reference Intake for Calcium The recommended dietary allowances (RDA) for calcium are listed in Table 10.1 “Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium”. The RDA is elevated to 1,300 milligrams per day during adolescence because this is the life stage with accelerated bone growth. Studies have shown that a higher intake of calcium during puberty increases the total amount of bone tissue that accumulates in a person. For women above age fifty and men older than seventy-one, the RDAs are also a bit higher for several reasons including that as we age, calcium absorption in the gut decreases, vitamin D3 activation is reduced, and maintaining adequate blood levels of calcium is important to prevent an acceleration of bone tissue loss (especially during menopause). Currently, the dietary intake of calcium for females above age nine is, on average, below the RDA for calcium. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends that people do not consume over 2,500 milligrams per day of calcium as it may cause adverse effects in some people.

For a list of non-dairy sources you can find the calcium content for thousands of foods by visiting the USDA National Nutrient Database (http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/ foodcomp/search/). When obtaining your calcium from a vegan diet, it is important to know that some plant-based foods significantly impair the absorption of calcium.

With careful planning and good selections, you can ensure that you are getting enough calcium in your diet even if you do not drink milk or consume other dairy products. Calcium Bioavailability In the small intestine, calcium absorption primarily takes place in the duodenum (first section of the small intestine) when intakes are low, but calcium is also absorbed passively in the jejunum and ileum (second and third sections of the small intestine), especially when intakes are higher.

The greatest positive influence on calcium absorption comes from having an adequate intake of vitamin D. People deficient in vitamin D absorb less than 15 percent of calcium from the foods they eat. The hormone estrogen is another factor that enhances calcium bioavailability. Thus, as a woman ages and goes through menopause, during which estrogen levels fall, the amount of calcium absorbed decreases and the risk for bone disease increases. Some fibers, such as inulin, found in jicama, onions, and garlic, also promote calcium intestinal uptake. Chemicals that bind to calcium decrease its bioavailability. These negative effectors of calcium absorption include the oxalates in certain plants, the tannins in tea, phytates in nuts, seeds, and grains, and some fibers.

These phosphate groups are essential as a structural component of cell membranes (as phospholipids), DNA and RNA, energy production (ATP), and regulation of acid- base homeostasis. Phosphorus however is mostly associated with calcium as a part of the mineral structure of bones and teeth. Blood phosphorus levels are not controlled as strictly as calcium so the PTH stimulates renal excretion of phosphate so that it does not accumulate to toxic levels. Dietary Reference Intakes for Phosphorus In comparison to calcium, most Americans are not at risk for having a phosphate deficiency. Phosphate is present in many foods popular in the American diet including meat, fish, dairy products, processed foods, and beverages. Phosphate is added to many foods because it acts as an emulsifying agent, prevents clumping, improves texture and taste, and extends shelf-life. The average intake of phosphorus in US adults ranges between 1,000 and 1,500 milligrams per day, well above the RDA of 700 milligrams per day.

Magnesium is not an integral part of the hard mineral crystals, but it does reside on the surface of the crystal and helps maximize bone structure. Observational studies link magnesium deficiency with an increased risk for osteoporosis. A magnesium- deficient diet is associated with decreased levels of parathyroid hormone and the activation of vitamin D, which may lead to an impairment of bone remodeling. A study in nine hundred elderly women and men did show that higher dietary intakes of magnesium correlated to an increased BMD in the hip.1 Only a few clinical trials have evaluated the effects of magnesium supplements on bone health and their results suggest some modest benefits on BMD. In addition to participating in bone maintenance, magnesium has several other functions in the body. In every reaction involving the 1. Tucker KL, Hannan MT, et al.(1994).

Some observational studies suggest mild magnesium deficiency is linked to increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Signs and symptoms of severe magnesium deficiency may include tremor, muscle spasms, loss of appetite, and nausea.

These include copper, zinc, selenium, iodine, chromium, fluoride, manganese, molybdenum, and others. Although trace minerals are needed in smaller amounts it is important to remember that a deficiency in a trace mineral can be just as detrimental to your health as a major mineral deficiency. Iodine deficiency is a major concern in countries around the world such as Fiji. In the 1990’s, almost 50% of the population had signs of iodine deficiency also known as goiter. To combat this national issue, the government of Fiji banned non-iodized salt and allowed only fortified iodized salt into the country in hopes of increasing the consumption of iodine in people’s diets. With this law, and health promotion efforts encouraging the consumption of seafood, great progress has been made in decreasing the prevalence of iodine deficiency in Fiji.1 Figure 11.1 The Trace Minerals 1.

It is composed of four globular peptides, each containing a heme complex. In the center of each heme, lies iron (Figure 11.2). Iron is needed for the production of other iron-containing proteins such as myoglobin. Myoglobin is a protein found in the muscle tissues that enhances the amount of available oxygen for muscle contraction. Iron is also a key component of hundreds of metabolic enzymes. Many of the proteins of the electron-transport chain contain iron–sulfur clusters involved in the transfer of high-energy electrons and ultimately ATP synthesis. Iron is also involved in numerous metabolic reactions that take place mainly in the liver and detoxify harmful substances. Moreover, iron is required for DNA synthesis. The great majority of iron used in the body is that recycled from the continuous breakdown of red blood cells.',\n",

The iron in hemoglobin binds to oxygen in the capillaries of the lungs and transports it to cells where the oxygen is released. If iron level is low hemoglobin is not synthesized in sufficient amounts and the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells is reduced, resulting in anemia. When iron levels are low in the diet the small intestine more efficiently absorbs iron in an attempt to compensate for the low dietary intake, but this process cannot make up for the excessive loss of iron that occurs with chronic blood loss or low intake. When blood cells are decommissioned for use, the body recycles the iron back to the bone marrow where red blood cells are made. The body stores some iron in the bone marrow, liver, spleen, and skeletal muscle. A relatively small amount of iron is excreted when cells lining the small intestine and skin cells die and in blood loss, such as during menstrual bleeding. The lost iron must be replaced from dietary sources. The bioavailability of iron is highly dependent on dietary sources.',\n",

Anemia is most often treated with iron supplements and increasing the consumption of foods that are higher in iron. Iron supplements have some adverse side effects including nausea, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Reducing the dose at first and then gradually increasing to the full dose often minimizes the side effects of iron supplements. Avoiding foods and beverages high in phytates and also tea (which contains tannic acid and polyphenols, both of which impair iron absorption), is important for people who have iron-deficiency anemia. Eating a dietary source of vitamin C at the same time as iron-containing foods improves absorption of nonheme iron in the gut. Additionally, unknown compounds that likely reside in muscle tissue of meat, poultry, and fish increase iron absorption from both heme and nonheme sources.

Additionally, those who have recently suffered from traumatic blood loss, frequently donate blood, or take excessive antacids for heartburn need more iron in the diet. Preventing Iron-Deficiency Anemia In young children iron-deficiency anemia can cause significant motor, mental, and behavioral abnormalities that are long-lasting. In the United States, the high incidence of iron-deficiency anemia in infants and children was a major public-health problem prior to the early 1970s, but now the incidence has been greatly reduced. This achievement was accomplished by implementing the screening of infants for iron-deficiency anemia in the health sector as a common practice, advocating the fortification of infant formulas and cereals with iron, and distributing them in supplemental food programs, such as that within Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Breastfeeding, iron supplementation, and delaying the introduction of cow’s milk for at least the first twelve months of life were also encouraged. These practices were implemented across the socioeconomic spectrum and by the 1980s iron-deficiency anemia in infants had significantly declined. Other solutions had to be introduced in young children, who no longer were fed breast milk or fortified formulas and were consuming cow’s milk. The following solutions were introduced to parents: provide a diet rich in sources of iron and vitamin C, limit cow’s milk consumption to less than twenty-four ounces per day, and a multivitamin containing iron. In the third world, iron-deficiency anemia remains a significant public-health challenge.',\n",

Zinc also is a cofactor for enzymes involved in energy metabolism. As the result of its prominent roles in anabolic and energy metabolism, a zinc deficiency in infants and children blunts growth. The reliance of growth on adequate dietary zinc was discovered in the early 1960s in the Middle East where adolescent nutritional dwarfism was linked to diets containing high amounts of phytate. Cereal grains and some vegetables contain chemicals, one being phytate, which blocks the absorption of zinc and other minerals in the gut. It is estimated that half of the world’s population has a zinc-deficient diet.1 This is largely a consequence of the lack of red meat and seafood in the diet and reliance on cereal grains as the main dietary staple. In adults, severe zinc deficiency can cause hair loss, diarrhea, skin sores, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Zinc is a required cofactor for an enzyme that synthesizes the heme portion of hemoglobin and severely deficient zinc diets can result in anemia. 1. Prasad, Ananda. (',\n",

The other important function of selenium is as an antioxidant. Selenium Functions and Health Benefits Around twenty-five known proteins require selenium to function. Some are enzymes involved in detoxifying free radicals and include glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductase. As an integral functioning part of these enzymes, selenium aids in the regeneration of glutathione and oxidized vitamin C. Selenium as part of glutathione peroxidase also protects lipids from free radicals, and, in doing so, spares vitamin E. This is just one example of how antioxidants work together to protect the body against free- radical induced damage. Other functions of selenium-containing proteins include protecting endothelial cells that line tissues, converting the inactive thyroid hormone to the active form in cells, and mediating inflammatory and immune system responses. Observational studies have demonstrated that selenium deficiency is linked to an increased risk of cancer. A review of forty- nine observational studies published in the May 2011 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews concluded that higher selenium exposure reduces overall cancer incidence by about 34 percent in men and 10 percent in women, but notes these studies had several limitations, including data quality, bias, and large Selenium | 675',\n",

Iodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormone, which regulates basal metabolism, growth, and development. Low iodine levels and consequently hypothyroidism has many signs and symptoms including fatigue, sensitivity to cold, constipation, weight gain, depression, and dry, itchy skin and paleness. The development of goiter may often be the most visible sign of chronic iodine deficiency, but the consequences of low levels of thyroid hormone can be severe during infancy, childhood, and adolescence as it affects all stages of growth and development. Thyroid hormone plays a major role in brain development and growth and fetuses and infants with severe iodine deficiency develop a condition known as cretinism, in which physical and neurological impairment can be severe.

It enhances the actions of insulin so it plays a role in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. Currently, the results of scientific studies evaluating the usefulness of chromium supplementation in preventing and treating Type 2 diabetes are largely inconclusive. More research is needed to better determine if chromium is helpful in treating certain chronic diseases and, if so, at what doses. If a deficiency of chromium occurs in the body, signs and symptoms include weight loss, peripheral neuropathy, elevated plasma glucose concentrations or impaired glucose use, and high plasma free fatty acid concentrations. Although toxicity of the mineral is a low risk in humans, it can cause DNA damage, organ damage, and renal problems. Tissues that are high in chromium include the liver, spleen, and bone.1 Dietary Reference Intakes for Chromium The recommended intake for chromium is 35 mcg per day for adult males and 25 mcg per day for adult females.

Figure 11.7 A Severe Case of Fluorosis Fluoride’s benefits to mineralized tissues of the teeth are well substantiated, but the effects of fluoride on bone are not as well known. Fluoride is currently being researched as a potential treatment for osteoporosis. The data are inconsistent on whether consuming fluoridated water reduces the incidence of osteoporosis and fracture risk. Fluoride does stimulate osteoblast bone building activity, and fluoride therapy in patients with osteoporosis has been shown to increase BMD. In general, it appears that at low doses, fluoride treatment increases BMD in people with osteoporosis and is more effective in increasing bone quality when the intakes of calcium and vitamin D are adequate. The Food and Drug Administration has not approved fluoride for the treatment of osteoporosis mainly because its benefits are not sufficiently known and it has several side effects including frequent stomach upset and joint pain.

For example, many Pacific Islanders have been unable to maintain their traditional diets for various environmental, social and demographic reasons. This has resulted in diets high in a variety of high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods. Frequent inadequate and/or excessive nutrient intake can lead to many health issues in a community such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Therefore, it is important to employ moderation and portion control by using all of the principles together to afford you lasting health benefits1. 1. Pacific Food Summit: Factsheet. (2010).

This DRI system is used in both the United States and Canada. Dietary Reference Intakes: A Brief Overview “Dietary Reference Intakes” (DRI) is an umbrella term for four reference values: • Estimated Average Requirements (EAR) • Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) • Adequate Intakes (AI) • Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (UL) The DRIs are not minimum or maximum nutritional requirements and are not intended to fit everybody. They are to be used as guides only for the majority of the healthy population1. 1. Deng S, West BJ, Jensen CJ. (2010).

       "  'sentence_chunk': 'DRIs are important not only to help the average person determine whether their intake of a particular nutrient is adequate, they are also used by health-care professionals and policy makers to determine nutritional recommendations for special groups of people who may need help reaching nutritional goals. This includes people who are participating in programs such as the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children. The DRI is not appropriate for people who are ill or malnourished, even if they were healthy previously. Determining Dietary Reference Intakes Each DRI value is derived in a different way. See below for an explanation of how each is determined: 1. Estimated Average Requirements. The EAR for a nutrient is determined by a committee of nutrition experts who review the scientific literature to determine a value that meets the requirements of 50 percent of people in their target group within a given life stage and for a particular sex. The requirements of half of the group will fall below the EAR and the other half will be above it. It is important to note that, for each nutrient, a specific bodily function is chosen as the criterion on which to base the EAR. For example, the EAR for calcium is set using a criterion of maximizing bone health.',\n",

       "  'sentence_chunk': '• Abnormal heart rate Iron-deficiency anemia is diagnosed from characteristic signs and symptoms and confirmed with simple blood tests that count red blood cells and determine hemoglobin and iron content in blood. Anemia is most often treated with iron supplements and increasing the consumption of foods that are higher in iron. Iron supplements have some adverse side effects including nausea, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Reducing the dose at first and then gradually increasing to the full dose often minimizes the side effects of iron supplements. Avoiding foods and beverages high in phytates and also tea (which contains tannic acid and polyphenols, both of which impair iron absorption), is important for people who have iron-deficiency anemia. Eating a dietary source of vitamin C at the same time as iron-containing foods improves absorption of nonheme iron in the gut. Additionally, unknown compounds that likely reside in muscle tissue of meat, poultry, and fish increase iron absorption from both heme and nonheme sources. See Table 17.2 “Enhancers and Inhibitors of Iron Absorption” for more enhancers and inhibitors for iron absorption.

      "Example 1:\n",
      "Query: What are the fat-soluble vitamins?\n",
      "Answer: The fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example 2:\n",
      "Query: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\n",
      "Answer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example 3:\n",
      "Query: What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?\n",
      "Answer: Hydration is crucial for physical performance because water plays key roles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke. Drinking sufficient water before, during, and after exercise helps ensure peak physical performance and recovery.\n",

      "- Image by Allison Calabrese / CC BY 4.0 fiber intake because of what the breakdown products of the fiber do for the colon. The bacterial breakdown of fiber in the large intestine releases short-chain fatty acids. These molecules have been found to nourish colonic cells, inhibit colonic inflammation, and stimulate the immune system (thereby providing protection of the colon from harmful substances). Additionally, the bacterial indigestible fiber, mostly insoluble, increases stool bulk and softness increasing transit time in the large intestine and facilitating feces elimination. One phenomenon of consuming foods high in fiber is increased gas, since the byproducts of bacterial digestion of fiber are gases. Figure 18.2 Diverticulitis: A Disease of Fiber Deficiency Some studies have found a link between high dietary-fiber intake and a decreased risk for colon cancer. However an analysis of 1086 | Nutrition, Health and Disease\n",
      " - Dietary fiber is categorized as either water-soluble or insoluble. Some examples of soluble fibers are inulin, pectin, and guar gum and they are found in peas, beans, oats, barley, and rye. Cellulose and lignin are insoluble fibers and a few dietary sources of them are whole-grain foods, flax, cauliflower, and avocados. Cellulose is the most abundant fiber in plants, making up the cell walls and providing structure. Soluble fibers are more easily accessible to bacterial enzymes in the large intestine so they can be broken down to a greater extent than insoluble fibers, but even some breakdown of cellulose and other insoluble fibers occurs. The last class of fiber is functional fiber. Functional fibers have been added to foods and have been shown to provide health benefits to humans. Functional fibers may be extracted from plants and purified or synthetically made. An example of a functional fiber is psyllium-seed husk. Scientific studies show that consuming psyllium-seed husk reduces blood-cholesterol levels and this health claim has been approved by the FDA.\n",
      " - Image by Allison Calabrese / CC BY 4.0 starches yielding more energy than insoluble fibers. Since dietary fiber is digested much less in the gastrointestinal tract than other carbohydrate types (simple sugars, many starches) the rise in blood glucose after eating them is less, and slower. These physiological attributes of high-fiber foods (i.e. whole grains) are linked to a decrease in weight gain and reduced risk of chronic diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Figure 4.9 Overview of Carbohydrate Digestion A Carbohydrate Feast You are at a your grandma’s house for family dinner and you just consumed kalua pig, white rice, sweet potatoes, mac salad, chicken long rice and a hot sweet bread roll dripping with butter. Less than an hour later you top it off with a slice of haupia pie and then lie down on the couch to watch TV. The “hormone of plenty,” insulin, answers the nutrient call. Insulin sends out the physiological message that glucose is abundant in the blood, so that cells can absorb it and either use it or store it.
